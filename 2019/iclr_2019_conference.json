    "title": "Layerwise Recurrent Autoencoder for General Real-world Traffic Flow Forecasting",
    "abstract": "Accurate spatio-temporal traffic forecasting is a fundamental task that has wide applications in city management, transportation area and financial domain. There are many factors that make this significant task also challenging, like: (1) maze-like road network makes the spatial dependency complex; (2) the traffic-time relationships bring non-linear temporal complication; (3) with the larger road network, the difficulty of flow forecasting grows. The prevalent and state-of-the-art methods have mainly been discussed on datasets covering relatively small districts and short time span, e.g., the dataset that is collected within a city during months. To forecast the traffic flow across a wide area and overcome the mentioned challenges, we design and propose a promising forecasting model called Layerwise Recurrent Autoencoder (LRA), in which a three-layer stacked autoencoder (SAE) architecture is used to obtain temporal traffic correlations and a recurrent neural networks (RNNs) model for prediction. The convolutional neural networks (CNNs) model is also employed to extract spatial traffic information within the transport topology for more accurate prediction. To the best of our knowledge, there is no general and effective method for traffic flow prediction in large area which covers a group of cities. The experiment is completed on such large scale real-world traffic datasets to show superiority. And a smaller dataset is exploited to prove universality of the proposed model. And evaluations show that our model outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines by 6% - 15%.",

    "title": "Machine Translation With Weakly Paired Bilingual Documents",
    "abstract": "Neural machine translation, which achieves near human-level performance in some languages, strongly relies on the availability of large amounts of parallel sentences, which hinders its applicability to low-resource language pairs. Recent works explore the possibility of unsupervised machine translation with monolingual data only, leading to much lower accuracy compared with the supervised one. Observing that weakly paired bilingual documents are much easier to collect than bilingual sentences, e.g., from Wikipedia, news websites or books, in this paper, we investigate the training of translation models with weakly paired bilingual documents. Our approach contains two components/steps. First, we provide a simple approach to mine implicitly bilingual sentence pairs from document pairs which can then be used as supervised signals for training. Second, we leverage the topic consistency of two weakly paired documents and learn the sentence-to-sentence translation by constraining the word distribution-level alignments.  We evaluate our proposed method on weakly paired documents from Wikipedia on four tasks, the widely used WMT16 German$\\leftrightarrow$English and WMT13 Spanish$\\leftrightarrow$English tasks, and obtain $24.1$/$30.3$ and $28.0$/$27.6$ BLEU points separately, outperforming\nstate-of-the-art unsupervised results by more than 5 BLEU points and reducing the gap between unsupervised translation and supervised translation up to 50\\%.

    "abstract": "At internet scale, applications collect a tremendous amount of data by logging user events, analyzing text, and collecting images. This data powers a variety of machine learning models for tasks such as image classification, language modeling, content recommendation, and advertising. However, training large models over all available data can be computationally expensive, creating a bottleneck in the development of new machine learning models. In this work, we develop a novel approach to efficiently select a subset of training data to achieve faster training with no loss in model predictive performance. In our approach, we first train a small proxy model quickly, which we then use to estimate the utility of individual training data points, and then select the most informative ones for training the large target model. Extensive experiments show that our approach leads to a 1.6x and 1.8x speed-up on CIFAR10 and SVHN by selecting 60% and 50% subsets of the data, while maintaining the predictive performance of the model trained on the entire dataset.",

    "title": "Learning Multi-Level Hierarchies with Hindsight",
    "abstract": "Hierarchical agents have the potential to solve sequential decision making tasks with greater sample efficiency than their non-hierarchical counterparts because hierarchical agents can break down tasks into sets of subtasks that only require short sequences of decisions.  In order to realize this potential of faster learning, hierarchical agents need to be able to learn their multiple levels of policies in parallel so these simpler subproblems can be solved simultaneously.  Yet, learning multiple levels of policies in parallel is hard because it is inherently unstable: changes in a policy at one level of the hierarchy may cause changes in the transition and reward functions at higher levels in the hierarchy, making it difficult to jointly learn multiple levels of policies.  In this paper, we introduce a new Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning (HRL) framework, Hierarchical Actor-Critic (HAC), that can overcome the instability issues that arise when agents try to jointly learn multiple levels of policies.  The main idea behind HAC is to train each level of the hierarchy independently of the lower levels by training each level as if the lower level policies are already optimal.  We demonstrate experimentally in both grid world and simulated robotics domains that our approach can significantly accelerate learning relative to other non-hierarchical and hierarchical methods.  Indeed, our framework is the first to successfully learn 3-level hierarchies in parallel in tasks with continuous state and action spaces.",

    "abstract": "Extensive work on compressed sensing has yielded a rich collection of sparse recovery algorithms, each making different tradeoffs between recovery condition and computational efficiency. In this paper, we propose a unified framework for accelerating various existing sparse recovery algorithms without sacrificing recovery guarantees by exploiting structure in the measurement matrix. Unlike fast algorithms that are specific to particular choices of measurement matrices where the columns are Fourier or wavelet filters for example, the proposed approach works on a broad range of measurement matrices that satisfy a particular property. We precisely characterize this property, which quantifies how easy it is to accelerate sparse recovery for the measurement matrix in question. We also derive the time complexity of the accelerated algorithm, which is sublinear in the signal length in each iteration. Moreover, we present experimental results on real world data that demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in practice. ",

    "abstract": "We provide a novel perspective on the forward pass through a block of layers in a deep network. In particular, we show that a forward pass through a standard dropout layer followed by a linear layer and a non-linear activation is equivalent to optimizing a convex objective with a single iteration of a $\\tau$-nice Proximal Stochastic Gradient method. We further show that replacing standard Bernoulli dropout with additive dropout is equivalent to optimizing the same convex objective with a variance-reduced proximal method. By expressing both fully-connected and convolutional layers as special cases of a high-order tensor product, we unify the underlying convex optimization problem in the tensor setting and derive a formula for the Lipschitz constant $L$ used to determine the optimal step size of the above proximal methods. We conduct experiments with standard convolutional networks applied to the CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets and show that replacing a block of layers with multiple iterations of the corresponding solver, with step size set via $L$, consistently improves classification accuracy.",

    "abstract": "Unsupervised image-to-image translation has gained considerable attention due to the recent impressive progress based on generative adversarial networks (GANs). However, previous methods often fail in challenging cases, in particular, when an image has multiple target instances and a translation task involves significant changes in shape, e.g., translating pants to skirts in fashion images. To tackle the issues, we propose a novel method, coined instance-aware GAN (InstaGAN), that incorporates the instance information (e.g., object segmentation masks) and improves multi-instance transfiguration. The proposed method translates both an image and the corresponding set of instance attributes while maintaining the permutation invariance property of the instances. To this end, we introduce a context preserving loss that encourages the network to learn the identity function outside of target instances. We also propose a sequential mini-batch inference/training technique that handles multiple instances with a limited GPU memory and enhances the network to generalize better for multiple instances. Our comparative evaluation demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed method on different image datasets, in particular, in the aforementioned challenging cases.

    "abstract": "Despite recent advances in deep learning, neural networks suffer catastrophic forgetting when tasks are learned sequentially. We propose a conceptually simple and general framework for continual learning, where structure optimization is considered explicitly during learning. We implement this idea by separating the structure and parameter learning. During structure learning, the model optimizes for the best structure for the current task. The model learns when to reuse or modify structure from previous tasks, or create new ones when necessary. The model parameters are then estimated with the optimal structure. Empirically, we found that our approach leads to sensible structures when learning multiple tasks continuously. Additionally, catastrophic forgetting is also largely alleviated from explicit learning of structures. Our method also outperforms all other baselines on the permuted MNIST and split CIFAR datasets in continual learning setting.",

    "abstract": "End-to-end task-oriented dialogue is challenging since knowledge bases are usually large, dynamic and hard to incorporate into a learning framework. We propose the global-to-local memory pointer (GLMP) networks to address this issue. In our model, a global memory encoder and a local memory decoder are proposed to share external knowledge. The encoder encodes dialogue history, modifies global contextual representation, and generates a global memory pointer. The decoder first generates a sketch response with unfilled slots. Next, it passes the global memory pointer to filter the external knowledge for relevant information, then instantiates the slots via the local memory pointers. We empirically show that our model can improve copy accuracy and mitigate the common out-of-vocabulary problem. As a result, GLMP is able to improve over the previous state-of-the-art models in both simulated bAbI Dialogue dataset and human-human Stanford Multi-domain Dialogue dataset on automatic and human evaluation.",

Instead of applying evolutionary algorithm or reinforcement learning as previous works, this paper proposes a Direct Sparse Optimization NAS (DSO-NAS) method. In DSO-NAS, we provide a novel model pruning view to NAS problem. In specific, we start from a completely connected block, and then introduce scaling factors to scale the information flow between operations. Next, we impose sparse regularizations to prune useless connections in the architecture. Lastly, we derive an efficient and theoretically sound optimization method to solve it. Our method enjoys both advantages of differentiability and efficiency, therefore can be directly applied to large datasets like ImageNet. Particularly, On CIFAR-10 dataset, DSO-NAS achieves an average test error 2.84%, while on the ImageNet dataset DSO-NAS achieves 25.4% test error under 600M FLOPs with 8 GPUs in 18 hours.",

We do this by formalizing prior work on VQA, called module networks (Andreas, 2016) as discrete, structured, latent variable models on the joint distribution over questions and answers given images, and devise a procedure to train the model effectively. Our results on a dataset of compositional questions about SHAPES (Andreas, 2016) show that our model generates more interpretable programs and obtains better accuracy on VQA in the low-data regime than prior work.

In this paper, we draw connections between recurrent networks and ordinary differential equations. A special form of recurrent networks called the AntisymmetricRNN is proposed under this theoretical framework, which is able to capture long-term dependencies thanks to the stability property of its underlying differential equation. Existing approaches to improving RNN trainability often incur significant computation overhead.  In comparison, AntisymmetricRNN achieves the same goal by design.  We showcase the advantage of this new architecture through extensive simulations and experiments. AntisymmetricRNN exhibits much more predictable dynamics. It outperforms regular LSTM models on tasks requiring long-term memory and matches the performance on tasks where short-term dependencies dominate despite being much simpler.",

    "abstract": "Existing neural networks are vulnerable to \"adversarial examples\"---created by adding maliciously designed small perturbations in inputs to induce a misclassification by the networks. The most investigated defense strategy is adversarial training which augments training data with adversarial examples. However, applying single-step adversaries in adversarial training does not support the robustness of the networks, instead, they will even make the networks to be overfitted. In contrast to the single-step, multi-step training results in the state-of-the-art performance on MNIST and CIFAR10, yet it needs a massive amount of time. Therefore, we propose a method, Stochastic Quantized Activation (SQA) that solves overfitting problems in single-step adversarial training and fastly achieves the robustness comparable to the multi-step. SQA attenuates the adversarial effects by providing random selectivity to activation functions and allows the network to learn robustness with only single-step training. Throughout the experiment, our method demonstrates the state-of-the-art robustness against one of the strongest white-box attacks as PGD training, but with much less computational cost. Finally, we visualize the learning process of the network with SQA to handle strong adversaries, which is different from existing methods.",

    "abstract": "For neural sequence model training, maximum likelihood (ML) has been commonly adopted to optimize model parameters with respect to the corresponding objective. However, in the case of sequence prediction tasks like neural machine translation (NMT), training with the ML-based cross entropy loss would often lead to models that overgeneralize and plunge into local optima. In this paper, we propose an extended loss function called dual skew divergence (DSD), which aims to give a better tradeoff between generalization ability and error avoidance during NMT training. Our empirical study indicates that switching to DSD loss after the convergence of ML training helps the model skip the local optimum and stimulates a stable performance improvement. The evaluations on WMT 2014 English-German and English-French translation tasks demonstrate that the proposed loss indeed helps bring about better translation performance than several baselines.",

    "title": "Sorting out Lipschitz function approximation",
    "abstract": "Training neural networks subject to a Lipschitz constraint is useful for generalization bounds, provable adversarial robustness, interpretable gradients, and Wasserstein distance estimation. By the composition property of Lipschitz functions, it suffices to ensure that each individual affine transformation or nonlinear activation function is 1-Lipschitz. The challenge is to do this while maintaining the expressive power.  We identify a necessary property for such an architecture: each of the layers must preserve the gradient norm during backpropagation. Based on this, we propose to combine a gradient norm preserving activation function, GroupSort, with norm-constrained weight matrices. We show that norm-constrained GroupSort architectures are universal Lipschitz function approximators. Empirically, we show that norm-constrained GroupSort networks achieve tighter estimates of Wasserstein distance than their ReLU counterparts and can achieve provable adversarial robustness guarantees with little cost to accuracy.",

    "abstract": "To study how mental object representations are related to behavior, we estimated sparse, non-negative representations of objects using human behavioral judgments on images representative of 1,854 object categories. These representations predicted a latent similarity structure between objects, which captured most of the explainable variance in human behavioral judgments. Individual dimensions in the low-dimensional embedding were found to be highly reproducible and interpretable as conveying degrees of taxonomic membership, functionality, and perceptual attributes. We further demonstrated the predictive power of the embeddings for explaining other forms of human behavior, including categorization, typicality judgments, and feature ratings, suggesting that the dimensions reflect human conceptual representations of objects beyond the specific task.",

    "abstract": "In machine learning tasks, overtting frequently crops up when the number of samples of target domain is insufﬁcient, for the generalization ability of the classiﬁer is poor in this circumstance. To solve this problem, transfer learning utilizes the knowledge of similar domains to improve the robustness of the learner. The main idea of existing transfer learning algorithms is to reduce the dierence between domains by sample selection or domain adaptation. However, no matter what transfer learning algorithm we use, the difference always exists and the hybrid training of source and target data leads to reducing ﬁtting capability of the learner on target domain. Moreover, when the relatedness between domains is too low, negative transfer is more likely to occur. To tackle the problem, we proposed a two-phase transfer learning architecture based on ensemble learning, which uses the existing transfer learning algorithms to train the weak learners in the ﬁrst stage, and uses the predictions of target data to train the ﬁnal learner in the second stage. Under this architecture, the ﬁtting capability and generalization capability can be guaranteed at the same time. We evaluated the proposed method on public datasets, which demonstrates the effectiveness and robustness of our proposed method.",

By integrating the conditional random fields (CRF) in the graph convolutional networks, we explicitly model a joint probability of the entire set of node labels, thus taking advantage of neighborhood label information in the node label prediction task. \nOur model could have both the representation capacity of graph neural networks and the prediction power of CRFs.

    "abstract": "In high-dimensional reinforcement learning settings with sparse rewards, performing\neffective exploration to even obtain any reward signal is an open challenge.\nWhile model-based approaches hold promise of better exploration via planning, it\nis extremely difficult to learn a reliable enough Markov Decision Process (MDP)\nin high dimensions (e.g., over 10^100 states). In this paper, we propose learning\nan abstract MDP over a much smaller number of states (e.g., 10^5), which we can\nplan over for effective exploration. We assume we have an abstraction function\nthat maps concrete states (e.g., raw pixels) to abstract states (e.g., agent position,\nignoring other objects). In our approach, a manager maintains an abstract\nMDP over a subset of the abstract states, which grows monotonically through targeted\nexploration (possible due to the abstract MDP). Concurrently, we learn a\nworker policy to travel between abstract states; the worker deals with the messiness\nof concrete states and presents a clean abstraction to the manager. On three of\nthe hardest games from the Arcade Learning Environment (Montezuma's,\nPitfall!, and Private Eye), our approach outperforms the previous\nstate-of-the-art by over a factor of 2 in each game. In Pitfall!, our approach is\nthe first to achieve superhuman performance without demonstrations.",

    "abstract": "Training neural networks is traditionally done by sequentially providing random mini-batches sampled uniformly from the entire dataset. In our work, we show that sampling mini-batches non-uniformly can both enhance the speed of learning and improve the final accuracy of the trained network. Specifically, we decompose the problem using the principles of curriculum learning: first, we sort the data by some difficulty measure; second, we sample mini-batches with a gradually increasing level of difficulty. We focus on CNNs trained on image recognition. Initially, we define the difficulty of a training image using transfer learning from some competitive \"teacher\" network trained on the Imagenet database, showing improvement in learning speed and final performance for both small and competitive networks, using the CIFAR-10 and the CIFAR-100 datasets. We then suggest a bootstrap alternative to evaluate the difficulty of points using the same network without relying on a \"teacher\" network, thus increasing the applicability of our suggested method. We compare this approach to a related version of Self-Paced Learning, showing that our method benefits learning while SPL impairs it.",

    "title": "Deconfounding Reinforcement Learning in Observational Settings",
    "abstract": "In this paper, we propose a general formulation to cope with a family of reinforcement learning tasks in observational settings, that is, learning good policies solely from the historical data produced by real environments with confounders (i.e., the factors affecting both actions and rewards). Based on the proposed approach, we extend one representative of reinforcement learning algorithms: the Actor-Critic method, to its deconfounding variant, which is also straightforward to be applied to other algorithms. In addition, due to lack of datasets in this direction, a benchmark is developed for deconfounding reinforcement learning algorithms by revising OpenAI Gym and MNIST. We demonstrate that the proposed algorithms are superior to traditional reinforcement learning algorithms in confounded environments. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that confounders are taken into consideration for addressing full reinforcement learning problems.",

DSGAN considers the scenario that the training samples of target distribution, $p_{t}$, are difficult to collect.\n\nSuppose there are two distributions  $p_{\\bar{d}}$ and $p_{d}$ such that the density of the target distribution can be the differences between the densities of $p_{\\bar{d}}$ and $p_{d}$. We show how to learn the target distribution $p_{t}$ only via samples from $p_{d}$ and $p_{\\bar{d}}$ (relatively easy to obtain).\n\nDSGAN has the flexibility to produce samples from various target distributions (e.g. the out-of-distribution). Two key applications, semi-supervised learning and adversarial training, are taken as examples to validate the effectiveness of DSGAN. We also provide theoretical analyses about the convergence of DSGAN.",

    "abstract": "Word inputs tend to be represented as single continuous vectors in deep neural networks. It is left to the subsequent layers of the network to extract relevant aspects of a word's meaning based on the context in which it appears. In this paper, we investigate whether word representations can be improved by explicitly incorporating the idea of latent roles. That is, we propose a role interaction layer (RIL) that consists of context-dependent (latent) role assignments and role-specific transformations. We evaluate the RIL on machine translation using two language pairs (En-De and En-Fi) and three datasets of varying size. We find that the proposed mechanism improves translation quality over strong baselines with limited amounts of data, but that the improvement diminishes as the size of data grows, indicating that powerful neural MT systems are capable of implicitly modeling role-word interaction by themselves. Our qualitative analysis reveals that the RIL extracts meaningful context-dependent roles and that it allows us to inspect more deeply the internal mechanisms of state-of-the-art neural machine translation systems.",

    "title": "Coverage and Quality Driven Training of Generative Image Models",
    "abstract": "Generative modeling of natural images has been extensively studied in recent years, yielding remarkable progress. Current state-of-the-art methods are either based on maximum likelihood estimation or adversarial training. Both methods have their own drawbacks, which are complementary in nature. The first leads to over-generalization as the maximum likelihood criterion encourages models to cover the support of the training data by heavily penalizing small masses assigned to training data. Simplifying assumptions in such models limits their capacity and makes them spill mass on unrealistic samples. The second leads to mode-dropping since adversarial training encourages high quality samples from the model, but only indirectly enforces diversity among the samples. To overcome these drawbacks we make two contributions. First, we propose a model that extends variational autoencoders by using deterministic invertible transformation layers to map samples from the decoder to the image space. This induces correlations among the pixels given the latent variables, improving over factorial decoders commonly used in variational autoencoders. Second, we propose a unified training approach that leverages coverage and quality based criteria.

    "title": "SNAS: stochastic neural architecture search",
    "abstract": "We propose Stochastic Neural Architecture Search (SNAS), an economical end-to-end solution to Neural Architecture Search (NAS) that trains neural operation parameters and architecture distribution parameters in same round of back-propagation, while maintaining the completeness and differentiability of the NAS pipeline. In this work, NAS is reformulated as an optimization problem on parameters of a joint distribution for the search space in a cell. To leverage the gradient information in generic differentiable loss for architecture search, a novel search gradient is proposed. We prove that this search gradient optimizes the same objective as reinforcement-learning-based NAS, but assigns credits to structural decisions more efficiently. This credit assignment is further augmented with locally decomposable reward to enforce a resource-efficient constraint. In experiments on CIFAR-10, SNAS takes less epochs to find a cell architecture with state-of-the-art accuracy than non-differentiable evolution-based and reinforcement-learning-based NAS, which is also transferable to ImageNet. It is also shown that child networks of SNAS can maintain the validation accuracy in searching, with which attention-based NAS requires parameter retraining to compete, exhibiting potentials to stride towards efficient NAS on big datasets.",

    "abstract": "We present a novel architecture of GAN for a disentangled representation learning. The new model architecture is inspired by Information Bottleneck (IB) theory thereby named IB-GAN. IB-GAN objective is similar to that of InfoGAN but has a crucial difference; a capacity regularization for mutual information is adopted, thanks to which the generator of IB-GAN can harness a latent representation in disentangled and interpretable manner. To facilitate the optimization of IB-GAN in practice, a new variational upper-bound is derived. With experiments on CelebA, 3DChairs, and dSprites datasets, we demonstrate that the visual quality of samples generated by IB-GAN is often better than those by β-VAEs. Moreover, IB-GAN achieves much higher disentanglement metrics score than β-VAEs or InfoGAN on the dSprites dataset.",

    "abstract": "Abstractive summarization has been studied using neural sequence transduction methods with datasets of large, paired document-summary examples. However, such datasets are rare and the models trained from them do not generalize to other domains. Recently, some progress has been made in learning sequence-to-sequence mappings with only unpaired examples. In our work, we consider the setting where there are only documents (product or business reviews) with no summaries provided, and propose an end-to-end, neural model architecture to perform unsupervised abstractive summarization. Our proposed model consists of an auto-encoder trained so that the mean of the representations of the input reviews decodes to a reasonable summary-review.  We consider variants of the proposed architecture and perform an ablation study to show the importance of specific components.  We show through metrics and human evaluation that the generated summaries are highly abstractive, fluent, relevant, and representative of the average sentiment of the input reviews.",

    "abstract": "Temporal Difference learning with function approximation has been widely used recently and has led to several successful results.  However, compared with the original tabular-based methods, one major drawback of temporal difference learning with neural networks and other function approximators is that they tend to over-generalize across temporally successive states, resulting in slow convergence and even instability. In this work, we propose a novel TD learning method, Hadamard product Regularized TD (HR-TD), that reduces over-generalization and thus leads to faster convergence. This approach can be easily applied to both linear and nonlinear function approximators. \nHR-TD is evaluated on several linear and nonlinear benchmark domains, where we show improvement in learning behavior and performance.",

    "abstract": "We propose a modification to traditional Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), which provides the ANNs with new aptitudes motivated by biological neurons.  Biological neurons work far beyond linearly summing up synaptic inputs and then transforming the integrated information.  A biological neuron change firing modes accordingly to peripheral factors (e.g., neuromodulators) as well as intrinsic ones.  Our modification connects a new type of ANN nodes, which mimic the function of biological neuromodulators and are termed modulators, to enable other traditional ANN nodes to adjust their activation sensitivities in run-time based on their input patterns.  In this manner, we enable the slope of the activation function to be context dependent.  This modification produces statistically significant improvements in comparison with traditional ANN nodes in the context of Convolutional Neural Networks and Long Short-Term Memory networks. ",

    "abstract": "One popular hypothesis of neural network generalization is that the flat local minima of loss surface in parameter space leads to good generalization. However, we demonstrate that loss surface in parameter space has no obvious relationship with generalization, especially under adversarial settings. Through visualizing decision surfaces in both parameter space and input space, we instead show that the geometry property of decision surface in input space correlates well with the adversarial robustness. We then propose an adversarial robustness indicator, which can evaluate a neural network's intrinsic robustness property without testing its accuracy under adversarial attacks. Guided by it, we further propose our robust training method. Without involving adversarial training, our method could enhance network's intrinsic adversarial robustness against various adversarial attacks.",

    "title": "Deep Decoder: Concise Image Representations from Untrained Non-convolutional Networks",
    "abstract": "Deep neural networks, in particular convolutional neural networks, have become highly effective tools for compressing images and solving inverse problems including denoising, inpainting, and reconstruction from few and noisy measurements. This success can be attributed in part to their ability to represent and generate natural images well. Contrary to classical tools such as wavelets, image-generating deep neural networks have a large number of parameters---typically a multiple of their output dimension---and need to be trained on large datasets. \nIn this paper, we propose an untrained simple image model, called the deep decoder, which is a deep neural network that can generate natural images from very few weight parameters.\nThe deep decoder has a simple architecture with no convolutions and fewer weight parameters than the output dimensionality. This underparameterization enables the deep decoder to compress images into a concise set of network weights, which we show is on par with wavelet-based thresholding. Further, underparameterization provides a barrier to overfitting, allowing the deep decoder to have state-of-the-art performance for denoising. The deep decoder is simple in the sense that each layer has an identical structure that consists of only one upsampling unit, pixel-wise linear combination of channels, ReLU activation, and channelwise normalization. This simplicity makes the network amenable to theoretical analysis, and it sheds light on the aspects of neural networks that enable them to form effective signal representations.",

    "title": "Learning to Infer and Execute 3D Shape Programs",
    "abstract": "Human perception of 3D shapes goes beyond reconstructing them as a set of points or a composition of geometric primitives: we also effortlessly understand higher-level shape structure such as the repetition and reflective symmetry of object parts. In contrast, recent advances in 3D shape sensing focus more on low-level geometry but less on these higher-level relationships. In this paper, we propose 3D shape programs, integrating bottom-up recognition systems with top-down, symbolic program structure to capture both low-level geometry and high-level structural priors for 3D shapes. Because there are no annotations of shape programs for real shapes, we develop neural modules that not only learn to infer 3D shape programs from raw, unannotated shapes, but also to execute these programs for shape reconstruction. After initial bootstrapping, our end-to-end differentiable model learns 3D shape programs by reconstructing shapes in a self-supervised manner. Experiments demonstrate that our model accurately infers and executes 3D shape programs for highly complex shapes from various categories. It can also be integrated with an image-to-shape module to infer 3D shape programs directly from an RGB image, leading to 3D shape reconstructions that are both more accurate and more physically plausible.",

    "title": "Assessing Generalization in Deep Reinforcement Learning",
    "abstract": "Deep reinforcement learning (RL) has achieved breakthrough results on many tasks, but has been shown to be sensitive to system changes at test time. As a result, building deep RL agents that generalize has become an active research area. Our aim is to catalyze and streamline community-wide progress on this problem by providing the first benchmark and a common experimental protocol for investigating generalization in RL. Our benchmark contains a diverse set of environments and our evaluation methodology covers both in-distribution and out-of-distribution generalization. To provide a set of baselines for future research, we conduct a systematic evaluation of state-of-the-art algorithms, including those that specifically tackle the problem of generalization. The experimental results indicate that in-distribution generalization may be within the capacity of current algorithms, while out-of-distribution generalization is an exciting challenge for future work.",

    "abstract": "Generative adversarial network (GAN) is one of the best known unsupervised learning techniques these days due to its superior ability to learn data distributions. In spite of its great success in applications, GAN is known to be notoriously hard to train. The tremendous amount of time it takes to run the training algorithm and its sensitivity to hyper-parameter tuning have been haunting researchers in this area. To resolve these issues, we need to first understand how GANs work. Herein, we take a step toward this direction by examining the dynamics of GANs. We relate a large class of GANs including the Wasserstein GANs to max-min optimization problems with the coupling term being linear over the discriminator. By developing new primal-dual optimization tools, we show that, with a proper stepsize choice, the widely used first-order iterative algorithm in training GANs would in fact converge to a stationary solution with a sublinear rate. The same framework also applies to multi-task learning and distributional robust learning problems. We verify our analysis on numerical examples with both synthetic and real data sets. We hope our analysis shed light on future studies on the theoretical properties of relevant machine learning problems.",

    "abstract": "\tIn this paper, we propose the Asynchronous Accelerated Nonuniform Randomized Block Coordinate Descent algorithm (A2BCD). We prove A2BCD converges linearly to a solution of the convex minimization problem at the same rate as NU_ACDM, so long as the maximum delay is not too large. This is the first asynchronous Nesterov-accelerated algorithm that attains any provable speedup. Moreover, we then prove that these algorithms both have optimal complexity. Asynchronous algorithms complete much faster iterations, and A2BCD has optimal complexity. Hence we observe in experiments that A2BCD is the top-performing coordinate descent algorithm, converging up to 4-5x faster than NU_ACDM on some data sets in terms of wall-clock time. To motivate our theory and proof techniques, we also derive and analyze a continuous-time analog of our algorithm and prove it converges at the same rate.",

    "title": "Lagging Inference Networks and Posterior Collapse in Variational Autoencoders",
    "abstract": "The variational autoencoder (VAE) is a popular combination of deep latent variable model and accompanying variational learning technique. By using a neural inference network to approximate the model's posterior on latent variables, VAEs efficiently parameterize a lower bound on marginal data likelihood that can be optimized directly via gradient methods. In practice, however, VAE training often results in a degenerate local optimum known as \"posterior collapse\" where the model learns to ignore the latent variable and the approximate posterior mimics the prior. In this paper, we investigate posterior collapse from the perspective of training dynamics. We find that during the initial stages of training the inference network fails to approximate the model's true posterior, which is a moving target. As a result, the model is encouraged to ignore the latent encoding and posterior collapse occurs. Based on this observation, we propose an extremely simple modification to VAE training to reduce inference lag: depending on the model's current mutual information between latent variable and observation, we aggressively optimize the inference network before performing each model update. Despite introducing neither new model components nor significant complexity over basic VAE, our approach is able to avoid the problem of collapse that has plagued a large amount of previous work. Empirically, our approach outperforms strong autoregressive baselines on text and image benchmarks in terms of held-out likelihood, and is competitive with more complex techniques for avoiding collapse while being substantially faster.",

    "title": "Environment Probing Interaction Policies",
    "abstract": "A key challenge in reinforcement learning (RL) is environment generalization: a policy trained to solve a task in one environment often fails to solve the same task in a slightly different test environment. A common approach to improve inter-environment transfer is to learn policies that are invariant to the distribution of testing environments. However, we argue that instead of being invariant, the policy should identify the specific nuances of an environment and exploit them to achieve better performance. In this work, we propose the “Environment-Probing” Interaction (EPI) policy, a policy that probes a new environment to extract an implicit understanding of that environment’s behavior. Once this environment-specific information is obtained, it is used as an additional input to a task-specific policy that can now perform environment-conditioned actions to solve a task. To learn these EPI-policies, we present a reward function based on transition predictability. Specifically, a higher reward is given if the trajectory generated by the EPI-policy can be used to better predict transitions. We experimentally show that EPI-conditioned task-specific policies significantly outperform commonly used policy generalization methods on novel testing environments.",

    "abstract": "Localizing a specific protein in a human cell is essential for understanding cellular functions and biological processes of underlying diseases. A promising, low-cost,and time-efficient biotechnology for localizing proteins is high-throughput fluorescence microscopy imaging (HTI). This imaging technique stains the protein of interest in a cell with fluorescent antibodies and subsequently takes a microscopic image.  Together with images of other stained proteins or cell organelles and the annotation by the Human Protein Atlas project, these images provide a rich source of information on the protein location which can be utilized by computational methods.  It is yet unclear how precise such methods are and whether they can compete with human experts.   We here focus on deep learning image analysis methods and, in particular, on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)since they showed overwhelming success across different imaging tasks. We pro-pose a novel CNN architecture “GapNet-PL” that has been designed to tackle the characteristics of HTI data and uses global averages of filters at different abstraction levels.   We present the largest comparison of CNN architectures including GapNet-PL for protein localization in HTI images of human cells.  GapNet-PL outperforms all other competing methods and reaches close to perfect localization in all 13 tasks with an average AUC of 98% and F1 score of 78%.  On a separate test set the performance of GapNet-PL was compared with three human experts and 25 scholars. GapNet-PL achieved an accuracy of 91%, significantly (p-value 1.1e−6) outperforming the best human expert with an accuracy of 72%.",

We develop a simple method for estimating parameters in implicit models that does not require knowledge of the form of the likelihood function or any derived quantities, but can be shown to be equivalent to maximizing likelihood under some conditions. Our result holds in the non-asymptotic parametric setting, where both the capacity of the model and the number of data examples are finite. We also demonstrate encouraging experimental results. ",

    "title": "Composing Complex Skills by Learning Transition Policies",
    "abstract": "Humans acquire complex skills by exploiting previously learned skills and making transitions between them. To empower machines with this ability, we propose a method that can learn transition policies which effectively connect primitive skills to perform sequential tasks without handcrafted rewards. To efficiently train our transition policies, we introduce proximity predictors which induce rewards gauging proximity to suitable initial states for the next skill. The proposed method is evaluated on a set of complex continuous control tasks in bipedal locomotion and robotic arm manipulation which traditional policy gradient methods struggle at. We demonstrate that transition policies enable us to effectively compose complex skills with existing primitive skills. The proposed induced rewards computed using the proximity predictor further improve training efficiency by providing more dense information than the sparse rewards from the environments. We make our environments, primitive skills, and code public for further research at https://youngwoon.github.io/transition .",

    "title": "Learning Factorized Multimodal Representations",
    "abstract": "Learning multimodal representations is a fundamentally complex research problem due to the presence of multiple heterogeneous sources of information. Although the presence of multiple modalities provides additional valuable information, there are two key challenges to address when learning from multimodal data: 1) models must learn the complex intra-modal and cross-modal interactions for prediction and 2) models must be robust to unexpected missing or noisy modalities during testing. In this paper, we propose to optimize for a joint generative-discriminative objective across multimodal data and labels. We introduce a model that factorizes representations into two sets of independent factors: multimodal discriminative and modality-specific generative factors. Multimodal discriminative factors are shared across all modalities and contain joint multimodal features required for discriminative tasks such as sentiment prediction. Modality-specific generative factors are unique for each modality and contain the information required for generating data. Experimental results show that our model is able to learn meaningful multimodal representations that achieve state-of-the-art or competitive performance on six multimodal datasets. Our model demonstrates flexible generative capabilities by conditioning on independent factors and can reconstruct missing modalities without significantly impacting performance. Lastly, we interpret our factorized representations to understand the interactions that influence multimodal learning.",

    "title": "Area Attention",
    "abstract": "Existing attention mechanisms, are mostly item-based in that a model is trained to attend to individual items in a collection (the memory) where each item has a predefined, fixed granularity, e.g., a character or a word. Intuitively, an area in the memory consisting of multiple items can be worth attending to as a whole. We propose area attention: a way to attend to an area of the memory, where each area contains a group of items that are either spatially adjacent when the memory has a 2-dimensional structure, such as images, or temporally adjacent for 1-dimensional memory, such as natural language sentences. Importantly, the size of an area, i.e., the number of items in an area or the level of aggregation, is dynamically determined via learning, which can vary depending on the learned coherence of the adjacent items. By giving the model the option to attend to an area of items, instead of only individual items, a model can attend to information with varying granularity. Area attention can work along multi-head attention for attending to multiple areas in the memory. We evaluate area attention on two tasks: neural machine translation (both character and token-level) and image captioning, and improve upon strong (state-of-the-art) baselines in all the cases. These improvements are obtainable with a basic form of area attention that is parameter free. In addition to proposing the novel concept of area attention, we contribute an efficient way for computing it by leveraging the technique of summed area tables.",

    "title": "Progressive Weight Pruning Of Deep Neural Networks Using ADMM",
    "abstract": "Deep neural networks (DNNs) although achieving human-level performance in many domains, have very large model size that hinders their broader applications on edge computing devices. Extensive research work have been conducted on DNN model compression or pruning. However, most of the previous work took heuristic approaches. This work proposes a progressive weight pruning approach based on ADMM (Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers), a powerful technique to deal with non-convex optimization problems with potentially combinatorial constraints. Motivated by dynamic programming, the proposed method reaches extremely high pruning rate by using partial prunings with moderate pruning rates. Therefore, it resolves the accuracy degradation and long convergence time problems when pursuing extremely high pruning ratios. It achieves up to 34× pruning rate for ImageNet dataset and 167× pruning rate for MNIST dataset, significantly higher than those reached by the literature work. Under the same number of epochs, the proposed method also achieves faster convergence and higher compression rates. The codes and pruned DNN models are released in the anonymous link bit.ly/2zxdlss.",

    "title": "Language Model Pre-training for Hierarchical Document Representations",
    "abstract": "Hierarchical neural architectures can efficiently capture long-distance dependencies and have been used for many document-level tasks such as summarization, document segmentation, and fine-grained sentiment analysis. However, effective usage of such a large context can difficult to learn, especially in the case where there is limited labeled data available.\nBuilding on the recent success of language model pretraining methods for learning flat representations of text, we propose algorithms for pre-training hierarchical document representations from unlabeled data. Unlike prior work, which has focused on pre-training contextual token representations or context-independent sentence/paragraph representations, our hierarchical document representations include fixed-length sentence/paragraph representations which integrate contextual information from the entire documents. Experiments on document segmentation, document-level question answering, and extractive document summarization demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed pre-training algorithms.",

    "title": "Hierarchical Generative Modeling for Controllable Speech Synthesis",
    "abstract": "This paper proposes a neural end-to-end text-to-speech (TTS) model which can control latent attributes in the generated speech that are rarely annotated in the training data, such as speaking style, accent, background noise, and recording conditions. The model is formulated as a conditional generative model with two levels of hierarchical latent variables. The first level is a categorical variable, which represents attribute groups (e.g. clean/noisy) and provides interpretability. The second level, conditioned on the first, is a multivariate Gaussian variable, which characterizes specific attribute configurations (e.g. noise level, speaking rate) and enables disentangled fine-grained control over these attributes. This amounts to using a Gaussian mixture model (GMM) for the latent distribution. Extensive evaluation demonstrates its ability to control the aforementioned attributes. In particular, it is capable of consistently synthesizing high-quality clean speech regardless of the quality of the training data for the target speaker.",

    "title": "3D-RelNet: Joint Object and Relational Network for 3D Prediction",
    "abstract": "We propose an approach to predict the 3D shape and pose for the objects present in a scene. Existing learning based methods that pursue this goal make independent predictions per object, and do not leverage the relationships amongst them. We argue that reasoning about these relationships is crucial, and present an approach to incorporate these in a 3D prediction framework. In addition to independent per-object predictions, we predict pairwise relations in the form of relative 3D pose, and demonstrate that these can be easily incorporated to improve object level estimates. We report performance across different datasets (SUNCG, NYUv2), and show that our approach significantly improves over independent prediction approaches while also outperforming alternate implicit reasoning methods.",

    "title": "SOM-VAE: Interpretable Discrete Representation Learning on Time Series",
    "abstract": "High-dimensional time series are common in many domains. Since human cognition is not optimized to work well in high-dimensional spaces, these areas could benefit from interpretable low-dimensional representations. However, most representation learning algorithms for time series data are difficult to interpret. This is due to non-intuitive mappings from data features to salient properties of the representation and non-smoothness over time.\nTo address this problem, we propose a new representation learning framework building on ideas from interpretable discrete dimensionality reduction and deep generative modeling. This framework allows us to learn discrete representations of time series, which give rise to smooth and interpretable embeddings with superior clustering performance. We introduce a new way to overcome the non-differentiability in discrete representation learning and present a gradient-based version of the traditional self-organizing map algorithm that is more performant than the original. Furthermore, to allow for a probabilistic interpretation of our method, we integrate a Markov model in the representation space.\nThis model uncovers the temporal transition structure, improves clustering performance even further and provides additional explanatory insights as well as a natural representation of uncertainty.\nWe evaluate our model in terms of clustering performance and interpretability on static (Fashion-)MNIST data, a time series of linearly interpolated (Fashion-)MNIST images, a chaotic Lorenz attractor system with two macro states, as well as on a challenging real world medical time series application on the eICU data set. Our learned representations compare favorably with competitor methods and facilitate downstream tasks on the real world data.",

    "title": "The Variational Deficiency Bottleneck",
    "abstract": "We introduce a bottleneck method for learning data representations based on channel deficiency, rather than the more traditional information sufficiency. A variational upper bound allows us to implement this method efficiently. The bound itself is bounded above by the variational information bottleneck objective, and the two methods coincide in the regime of single-shot Monte Carlo approximations. The notion of deficiency provides a principled way of approximating complicated channels by relatively simpler ones. The deficiency of one channel w.r.t. another has an operational interpretation in terms of the optimal risk gap of decision problems, capturing classification as a special case. Unsupervised generalizations are possible, such as the deficiency autoencoder, which can also be formulated in a variational form. Experiments demonstrate that the deficiency bottleneck can provide advantages in terms of minimal sufficiency as measured by information bottleneck curves, while retaining a good test performance in classification and reconstruction tasks.

    "title": "Differentiable Learning-to-Normalize via Switchable Normalization",
    "abstract": "We address a learning-to-normalize problem by proposing Switchable Normalization (SN), which learns to select different normalizers for different normalization layers of a deep neural network. SN employs three distinct scopes to compute statistics (means and variances) including a channel, a layer, and a minibatch. SN switches between them by learning their importance weights in an end-to-end manner. It has several good properties. First, it adapts to various network architectures and tasks (see Fig.1). Second, it is robust to a wide range of batch sizes, maintaining high performance even when small minibatch is presented (e.g. 2 images/GPU). Third, SN does not have sensitive hyper-parameter, unlike group normalization that searches the number of groups as a hyper-parameter. Without bells and whistles, SN outperforms its counterparts on various challenging benchmarks, such as ImageNet, COCO, CityScapes, ADE20K, and Kinetics. Analyses of SN are also presented. We hope SN will help ease the usage and understand the normalization techniques in deep learning. The code of SN will be released.",

    "title": "Out-of-Sample Extrapolation with Neuron Editing",
    "abstract": "While neural networks can be trained to map from one specific dataset to another, they usually do not learn a generalized transformation that can extrapolate accurately outside the space of training. For instance, a generative adversarial network (GAN) exclusively trained to transform images of cars from light to dark might not have the same effect on images of horses. This is because neural networks are good at generation within the manifold of the data that they are trained on. However, generating new samples outside of the manifold or extrapolating \"out-of-sample\" is a much harder problem that has been less well studied. To address this, we introduce a technique called neuron editing that learns how neurons encode an edit for a particular transformation in a latent space. We use an autoencoder to decompose the variation within the dataset into activations of different neurons and generate transformed data by defining an editing transformation on those neurons. By performing the transformation in a latent trained space, we encode fairly complex and non-linear transformations to the data with much simpler distribution shifts to the neuron's activations. We showcase our technique on image domain/style transfer and two biological applications: removal of batch artifacts representing unwanted noise and modeling the effect of drug treatments to predict synergy between drugs.",

    "abstract": "High-dimensional sparse reward tasks present major challenges for reinforcement learning agents.  In this work we use imitation learning to address two of these challenges:  how to learn a useful representation of the world e.g.  from pixels, and how to explore efficiently given the rarity of a reward signal? We show that adversarial imitation can work well even in this high dimensional observation space. Surprisingly the adversary itself, acting as the learned reward function, can be tiny, comprising as few as 128 parameters, and can be easily trained using the most basic GAN formulation. Our approach removes limitations present in most contemporary imitation approaches: requiring no demonstrator actions (only video), no special initial conditions or warm starts, and no explicit tracking of any single demo. The proposed agent can solve a challenging robot manipulation task of block stacking from only video demonstrations and sparse reward, in which the non-imitating agents fail to learn completely.  Furthermore, our agent learns much faster than competing approaches that depend on hand-crafted, staged dense reward functions, and also better compared to standard GAIL baselines. Finally, we develop a new adversarial goal recognizer that in some cases allows the agent to learn stacking without any task reward, purely from imitation.",

We identify a pathological optimization issue with the commonly adopted stochastic minimization of the (reverse) KL divergence, owing to sparse gradient signal from the teacher model due to curse of dimensionality. We also explore alternative principles for distillation, and show that one can achieve qualitatively better results than with KL minimization. \n",

    "title": "Neural Predictive Belief Representations",
    "abstract": "Unsupervised representation learning has succeeded with excellent results in many applications. It is an especially powerful tool  to learn a good representation of environments with partial or noisy observations. In partially observable domains it is important for the representation to encode a belief state---a sufficient statistic of the observations seen so far. In this paper, we investigate whether it is possible to learn such a belief representation using modern neural architectures. Specifically, we focus on one-step frame prediction and two variants of contrastive predictive coding (CPC)  as the objective functions to learn the representations. To evaluate these learned representations, we test how well they can predict various pieces of information about the underlying state of the environment, e.g., position of the agent in a 3D maze. We show that all three methods are able to learn belief representations of the environment---they encode not only the state information, but also its uncertainty, a crucial aspect of belief states. We also find that for CPC multi-step predictions and action-conditioning are critical for accurate belief representations in visually complex environments. The ability of neural representations to capture the belief information has the potential to spur new advances for learning and planning in partially observable domains, where leveraging uncertainty is essential for optimal decision making.",

By formulating both the problems of value function estimation and policy learning as bilevel optimization problems, we propose online Q-learning and actor-critic algorithms for these two problems respectively.   Our algorithms are gradient-based methods and thus are computationally efficient. Moreover, by approximating the iterates using differential equations,   we establish convergence guarantees for the proposed algorithms. Thorough numerical experiments are conducted to back up our theory.",

The originality of our approach is that VarNet is not only capable of handling pre-defined attributes but can also learn the relevant attributes of the dataset by itself.  These two settings can be easily combined  which makes VarNet applicable for a wide variety of tasks. Further, VarNet has a sound probabilistic interpretation which grants us with  a novel way to navigate in the latent spaces as well as means to control how the  attributes are learned. We demonstrate  experimentally that this model is capable of performing interesting input manipulation  and that the learned attributes are relevant and interpretable.",

    "title": "An analytic theory of generalization dynamics and transfer learning in deep linear networks",
    "abstract": "Much attention has been devoted recently to the generalization puzzle in deep learning: large, deep networks can generalize well, but existing theories bounding generalization error are exceedingly loose, and thus cannot explain this striking performance. Furthermore, a major hope is that knowledge may transfer across tasks, so that multi-task learning can improve generalization on individual tasks. However we lack analytic theories that can quantitatively predict how the degree of knowledge transfer depends on the relationship between the tasks. We develop an analytic theory of the nonlinear dynamics of generalization in deep linear networks, both within and across tasks. In particular, our theory provides analytic solutions to the training and testing error of deep networks as a function of training time, number of examples, network size and initialization, and the task structure and SNR. Our theory reveals that deep networks progressively learn the most important task structure first, so that generalization error at the early stopping time primarily depends on task structure and is independent of network size. This suggests any tight bound on generalization error must take into account task structure, and explains observations about real data being learned faster than random data. Intriguingly our theory also reveals the existence of a learning algorithm that proveably out-performs neural network training through gradient descent. Finally, for transfer learning, our theory reveals that knowledge transfer depends sensitively, but computably, on the SNRs and input feature alignments of pairs of tasks.",

    "abstract": "Recurrent neural networks are known for their notorious exploding and vanishing gradient problem (EVGP). This problem becomes more evident in tasks where the information needed to correctly solve them exist over long time scales, because EVGP prevents important gradient components from being back-propagated adequately over a large number of steps. We introduce a simple stochastic algorithm (\\textit{h}-detach) that is specific to LSTM optimization and targeted towards addressing this problem. Specifically, we show that when the LSTM weights are large, the gradient components through the linear path (cell state) in the LSTM computational graph get suppressed. Based on the hypothesis that these components carry information about long term dependencies (which we show empirically), their suppression can prevent LSTMs from capturing them. Our algorithm\\footnote{Our code is available at https://github.com/bhargav104/h-detach.} prevents gradients flowing through this path from getting suppressed, thus allowing the LSTM to capture such dependencies better. We show significant improvements over vanilla LSTM gradient based training in terms of convergence speed, robustness to seed and learning rate, and generalization using our modification of LSTM gradient on various benchmark datasets.",

    "abstract": "Within many machine learning algorithms, a fundamental problem concerns efficient calculation of an unbiased gradient wrt parameters $\\boldsymbol{\\gamma}$ for expectation-based objectives $\\mathbb{E}_{q_{\\boldsymbol{\\gamma}} (\\boldsymbol{y})} [f (\\boldsymbol{y}) ]$. Most existing methods either ($i$) suffer from high variance, seeking help from (often) complicated variance-reduction techniques; or ($ii$) they only apply to reparameterizable continuous random variables and employ a reparameterization trick. To address these limitations, we propose a General and One-sample (GO) gradient that ($i$) applies to many distributions associated with non-reparameterizable continuous {\\em or} discrete random variables, and ($ii$) has the same low-variance as the reparameterization trick. We find that the GO gradient often works well in practice based on only one Monte Carlo sample (although one can of course use more samples if desired). Alongside the GO gradient, we develop a means of propagating the chain rule through distributions, yielding statistical back-propagation, coupling neural networks to common random variables.",

    "title": "On the Statistical and Information Theoretical Characteristics of DNN Representations",
    "abstract": "It has been common to argue or imply that a regularizer can be used to alter a statistical property of a hidden layer's representation and thus improve generalization or performance of deep networks. For instance, dropout has been known to improve performance by reducing co-adaptation, and representational sparsity has been argued as a good characteristic because many data-generation processes have only a small number of factors that are independent. In this work, we analytically and empirically investigate the popular characteristics of learned representations, including correlation, sparsity, dead unit, rank, and mutual information, and disprove many of the \\textit{conventional wisdom}. We first show that infinitely many Identical Output Networks (IONs) can be constructed for any deep network with a linear layer, where any invertible affine transformation can be applied to alter the layer's representation characteristics. The existence of ION proves that the correlation characteristics of representation can be either low or high for a well-performing network. Extensions to ReLU layers are provided, too. Then, we consider sparsity, dead unit, and rank to show that only loose relationships exist among the three characteristics. It is shown that a higher sparsity or additional dead units do not imply a better or worse performance when the rank of representation is fixed. We also develop a rank regularizer and show that neither representation sparsity nor lower rank is helpful for improving performance even when the data-generation process has only a small number of independent factors. Mutual information $I(\\z_l;\\x)$ and $I(\\z_l;\\y)$ are investigated as well, and we show that regularizers can affect $I(\\z_l;\\x)$ and thus indirectly influence the performance. Finally, we explain how a rich set of regularizers can be used as a powerful tool for performance tuning. ",

    "title": "Characterizing Attacks on Deep Reinforcement Learning",
    "abstract": "Deep Reinforcement learning (DRL) has achieved great success in various applications, such as playing computer games and controlling robotic manipulation. However, recent studies show that machine learning models are vulnerable to adversarial examples, which are carefully crafted instances that aim to mislead learning models to make arbitrarily incorrect prediction, and raised severe security concerns. DRL has been attacked by adding perturbation to each observed frame. However, such observation based attacks are not quite realistic considering that it would be hard for adversaries to directly manipulate pixel values in practice. Therefore, we propose to understand the vulnerabilities of DRL from various perspectives and  provide a throughout taxonomy of adversarial perturbation against DRL, and we conduct the first experiments on unexplored parts of this taxonomy.  In addition to current observation based attacks against DRL, we  propose attacks based on the actions and environment dynamics.  Among these experiments, we introduce a novel sequence-based attack to attack a sequence of frames for real-time scenarios such as autonomous driving, and the first targeted attack that perturbs environment dynamics to let the agent fail in a specific way. We show empirically that our sequence-based attack can generate effective perturbations in a blackbox setting in real time with a small number of queries, independent of episode length. We conduct extensive experiments to compare the effectiveness of different attacks with several baseline attack methods in several game playing, robotics control, and autonomous driving environments.",

    "title": "Defensive Quantization: When Efficiency Meets Robustness",
    "abstract": "Neural network quantization is becoming an industry standard to efficiently deploy deep learning models on hardware platforms, such as CPU, GPU, TPU, and FPGAs. However, we observe that the conventional quantization approaches are vulnerable to adversarial attacks. This paper aims to raise people's awareness about the security of the quantized models, and we designed a novel quantization methodology to jointly optimize the efficiency and robustness of deep learning models. We first conduct an empirical study to show that vanilla quantization suffers more from adversarial attacks. We observe that the inferior robustness comes from the error amplification effect, where the quantization operation further enlarges the distance caused by amplified noise. Then we propose a novel Defensive Quantization (DQ) method by controlling the Lipschitz constant of the network during quantization, such that the magnitude of the adversarial noise remains non-expansive during inference. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10 and SVHN datasets demonstrate that our new quantization method can defend neural networks against adversarial examples, and even achieves superior robustness than their full-precision counterparts, while maintaining the same hardware efficiency as vanilla quantization approaches. As a by-product, DQ can also improve the accuracy of quantized models without adversarial attack. ",

    "abstract": "Network Embeddings (NEs) map the nodes of a given network into $d$-dimensional Euclidean space $\\mathbb{R}^d$. Ideally, this mapping is such that 'similar' nodes are mapped onto nearby points, such that the NE can be used for purposes such as link prediction (if 'similar' means being 'more likely to be connected') or classification (if 'similar' means 'being more likely to have the same label'). In recent years various methods for NE have been introduced, all following a similar strategy: defining a notion of similarity between nodes (typically some distance measure within the network), a distance measure in the embedding space, and a loss function that penalizes large distances for similar nodes and small distances for dissimilar nodes.\n\nA difficulty faced by existing methods is that certain networks are fundamentally hard to embed due to their structural properties: (approximate) multipartiteness, certain degree distributions, assortativity, etc. To overcome this, we introduce a conceptual innovation to the NE literature and propose to create \\emph{Conditional Network Embeddings} (CNEs); embeddings that maximally add information with respect to given structural properties (e.g. node degrees, block densities, etc.). We use a simple Bayesian approach to achieve this, and propose a block stochastic gradient descent algorithm for fitting it efficiently.\n\nWe demonstrate that CNEs are superior for link prediction and multi-label classification when compared to state-of-the-art methods, and this without adding significant mathematical or computational complexity. Finally, we illustrate the potential of CNE for network visualization.",

    "abstract": "Recent works find that DNNs are  vulnerable to adversarial examples, whose changes from the benign ones are imperceptible and yet lead DNNs to make wrong predictions. One can find various adversarial examples for the same input to a DNN using different attack methods. In other words, there is a population of adversarial examples, instead of only one, for any input to a DNN. By explicitly modeling this adversarial population with a Gaussian distribution, we propose a new black-box attack called NATTACK. The adversarial attack is hence formalized as an optimization problem, which searches the mean of the Gaussian under the guidance of increasing the target DNN's prediction error. NATTACK achieves 100%  attack success rate  on six out of eleven recently published defense methods (and greater than 90% for four), all using the same algorithm. Such results are on par with or better than  powerful state-of-the-art white-box attacks. While the white-box attacks are often model-specific or defense-specific, the proposed black-box NATTACK is universally applicable to different defenses. ",

    "abstract": "In a number of practical applications that rely on dimensionality reduction, the dataset or measurement process provides valuable side information that can be incorporated when learning low-dimensional embeddings. We propose the inclusion of pairwise representation constraints into autoencoders (AEs) with the goal of promoting application-specific structure. We use synthetic results to show that only a small amount of AE representation constraints are required to substantially improve the local and global neighborhood preserving properties of the learned embeddings. To demonstrate the efficacy of our approach and to illustrate a practical application that naturally provides such representation constraints, we focus on wireless positioning using a recently proposed channel charting framework. We show that representation-constrained AEs recover the global geometry of the learned low-dimensional representations, which enables channel charting to perform approximate positioning without access to global navigation satellite systems or supervised learning methods that rely on extensive measurement campaigns.

However, a determinate input distribution as well as a specific architecture of neural networks may impose limitations on capturing the diversity in the high dimensional target space. To resolve this difficulty, we propose a training framework that greedily produce a series of generative adversarial networks that incrementally capture the diversity of the target space. We show theoretically and empirically that our training algorithm converges to the theoretically optimal distribution, the projection of the real distribution onto the convex hull of the network's distribution space.",

    "abstract": "We study the problem of learning classifiers robust to universal adversarial perturbations. While prior work approaches this problem via robust optimization, adversarial training, or input transformation, we instead phrase it as a two-player zero-sum game. In this new formulation, both players simultaneously play the same game, where one player chooses a classifier that minimizes a classification loss whilst the other player creates an adversarial perturbation that increases the same loss when applied to every sample in the training set.\nBy observing that performing a classification (respectively creating adversarial samples) is the best response to the other player, we propose a novel extension of a game-theoretic algorithm, namely fictitious play,  to the domain of training robust classifiers. Finally, we empirically show the robustness and versatility of our approach in two defence scenarios where universal attacks are performed on several image classification datasets -- CIFAR10, CIFAR100 and ImageNet.",

    "title": "Link Prediction in Hypergraphs using Graph Convolutional Networks",
    "abstract": "Link prediction in simple graphs is a fundamental problem in which new links between nodes are predicted based on the observed structure of the graph. However, in many real-world applications, there is a need to model relationships among nodes which go beyond pairwise associations. For example, in a chemical reaction, relationship among the reactants and products is inherently higher-order. Additionally, there is need to represent the direction from reactants to products. Hypergraphs provide a natural way to represent such complex higher-order relationships. Even though Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN) have recently emerged as a powerful deep learning-based approach for link prediction over simple graphs, their suitability for link prediction in hypergraphs is unexplored -- we fill this gap in this paper and propose Neural Hyperlink Predictor (NHP). NHP adapts GCNs for link prediction in hypergraphs. We propose two variants of NHP --NHP-U and NHP-D -- for link prediction over undirected and directed hypergraphs, respectively. To the best of our knowledge, NHP-D is the first method for link prediction over directed hypergraphs. Through extensive experiments on multiple real-world datasets, we show NHP's effectiveness.",

    "abstract": "Multiview stereo aims to reconstruct scene depth from images acquired by a camera under arbitrary motion. Recent methods address this problem through deep learning, which can utilize semantic cues to deal with challenges such as textureless and reflective regions. In this paper, we present a convolutional neural network called DPSNet (Deep Plane Sweep Network) whose design is inspired by best practices of traditional geometry-based approaches. Rather than directly estimating depth and/or optical flow correspondence from image pairs as done in many previous deep learning methods, DPSNet takes a plane sweep approach that involves building a cost volume from deep features using the plane sweep algorithm, regularizing the cost volume via a context-aware cost aggregation, and regressing the depth map from the cost volume. The cost volume is constructed using a differentiable warping process that allows for end-to-end training of the network. Through the effective incorporation of conventional multiview stereo concepts within a deep learning framework, DPSNet achieves state-of-the-art reconstruction results on a variety of challenging datasets.",

    "abstract": "The goal of program synthesis is to automatically generate programs in a particular language from corresponding specifications, e.g. input-output behavior.\nMany current approaches achieve impressive results after training on randomly generated I/O examples in limited domain-specific languages (DSLs), as with string transformations in RobustFill.\nHowever, we empirically discover that applying test input generation techniques for languages with control flow and rich input space causes deep networks to generalize poorly to certain data distributions;\nto correct this, we propose a new methodology for controlling and evaluating the bias of synthetic data distributions over both programs and specifications.\nWe demonstrate, using the Karel DSL and a small Calculator DSL, that training deep networks on these distributions leads to improved cross-distribution generalization performance.

    "title": "Language Modeling Teaches You More Syntax than Translation Does: Lessons Learned Through Auxiliary Task Analysis",
    "abstract": "Recent work using auxiliary prediction task classifiers to investigate the properties of LSTM representations has begun to shed light on why pretrained representations, like ELMo (Peters et al., 2018) and CoVe (McCann et al., 2017), are so beneficial for neural language understanding models. We still, though, do not yet have a clear understanding of how the choice of pretraining objective affects the type of linguistic information that models learn. With this in mind, we compare four objectives - language modeling, translation, skip-thought, and autoencoding - on their ability to induce syntactic and part-of-speech information.  We make a fair comparison between the tasks by holding constant the quantity and genre of the training data, as well as the LSTM architecture. We find that representations from language models consistently perform best on our syntactic auxiliary prediction tasks, even when trained on relatively small amounts of data. These results suggest that language modeling may be the best data-rich pretraining task for transfer learning applications requiring syntactic information. We also find that the representations from randomly-initialized, frozen LSTMs perform strikingly well on our syntactic auxiliary tasks, but this effect disappears when the amount of training data for the auxiliary tasks is reduced.",

The transferability of adversarial examples is known to enable attacks capable of tricking the agent into bad states.

We then propose an algorithm called DadQN, based on deep Q-networks, which enables the use of stronger defenses, including defenses enabling the first ever on-line robustness certification of a deep RL agent.",

Recent works show that continuous communication allows efficient training with back-propagation in multi-agent scenarios, but have been restricted to fully-cooperative tasks. In this paper, we present Individualized Controlled Continuous Communication Model (IC3Net) which has better training efficiency than simple continuous communication model, and can be applied to semi-cooperative and competitive settings along with the cooperative settings. IC3Net controls continuous communication with a gating mechanism and uses individualized rewards foreach agent to gain better performance and scalability while fixing credit assignment issues. Using variety of tasks including StarCraft BroodWars explore and combat scenarios, we show that our network yields improved performance and convergence rates than the baselines as the scale increases. Our results convey that IC3Net agents learn when to communicate based on the scenario and profitability.",

    "title": "Q-map: a Convolutional Approach for Goal-Oriented Reinforcement Learning",
    "abstract": "Goal-oriented learning has become a core concept in reinforcement learning (RL), extending the reward signal as a sole way to define tasks. However, as parameterizing value functions with goals increases the learning complexity, efficiently reusing past experience to update estimates towards several goals at once becomes desirable but usually requires independent updates per goal.\nConsidering that a significant number of RL environments can support spatial coordinates as goals, such as on-screen location of the character in ATARI or SNES games, we propose a novel goal-oriented agent called Q-map that utilizes an autoencoder-like neural network to predict the minimum number of steps towards each coordinate in a single forward pass. This architecture is similar to Horde with parameter sharing and allows the agent to discover correlations between visual patterns and navigation. For example learning how to use a ladder in a game could be transferred to other ladders later.\nWe show how this network can be efficiently trained with a 3D variant of Q-learning to update the estimates towards all goals at once. While the Q-map agent could be used for a wide range of applications, we propose a novel exploration mechanism in place of epsilon-greedy that relies on goal selection at a desired distance followed by several steps taken towards it, allowing long and coherent exploratory steps in the environment.\nWe demonstrate the accuracy and generalization qualities of the Q-map agent on a grid-world environment and then demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed exploration mechanism on the notoriously difficult Montezuma's Revenge and Super Mario All-Stars games.",

    "title": "Deep learning generalizes because the parameter-function map is biased towards simple functions",
    "abstract": "Deep neural networks (DNNs) generalize remarkably well without explicit regularization even in the strongly over-parametrized regime  where classical learning theory would instead predict that they would severely overfit.  While many proposals for some kind of implicit regularization have been made to rationalise this success, there is no consensus for the fundamental reason why DNNs do not strongly overfit.  In this paper, we provide a new explanation. By applying a very general probability-complexity bound recently derived from  algorithmic information theory (AIT), we argue that the parameter-function map of many DNNs should be exponentially biased towards simple functions. We then provide clear evidence for this strong simplicity bias in a model DNN for Boolean functions, as well as in much larger fully connected and convolutional networks trained on CIFAR10 and MNIST.\nAs the target functions in many real problems are expected to be highly structured, this intrinsic simplicity bias helps explain why deep networks generalize well on real world problems.\nThis picture also facilitates a novel PAC-Bayes approach where the prior is taken over the DNN input-output function space, rather than  the more conventional prior over parameter space.  If we assume that the training algorithm samples parameters close to uniformly within the zero-error region then the PAC-Bayes theorem can be used to guarantee good expected generalization for target functions producing high-likelihood training sets.  By exploiting recently discovered connections between DNNs and Gaussian processes to estimate the marginal likelihood,  we produce relatively tight generalization PAC-Bayes error bounds which correlate well with the true error on realistic datasets such as MNIST and CIFAR10 and for architectures including convolutional and fully connected networks.",

    "title": "Analysis of Quantized Models",
    "abstract": "Deep neural networks are usually huge, which significantly limits the deployment on low-end devices. In recent years, many\nweight-quantized models have  been proposed. They have small storage and fast inference, but training can still be time-consuming. This can be improved with distributed learning. To reduce the high communication cost due to worker-server synchronization, recently gradient quantization has also been proposed to train deep networks with full-precision weights. \nIn this paper, we theoretically study how the combination of both weight and gradient quantization affects convergence.\nWe show  that (i) weight-quantized models converge to an error related to the weight quantization resolution and weight dimension; (ii) quantizing gradients slows convergence by a factor related to the gradient quantization resolution and dimension; and (iii) clipping the gradient before quantization renders this factor dimension-free, thus allowing the use of fewer bits for gradient quantization. Empirical experiments confirm the theoretical convergence results, and demonstrate that quantized networks can speed up training and have comparable performance as full-precision networks.",

    "abstract": "We reconsider the training objective of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) from the mixed Nash Equilibria (NE) perspective. Inspired by the classical prox methods, we develop a novel algorithmic framework for GANs via an infinite-dimensional two-player game and prove rigorous convergence rates to the mixed NE. We then propose a principled procedure to reduce our novel prox methods to simple sampling routines, leading to practically efficient algorithms. Finally, we provide experimental evidence that our approach outperforms methods that seek pure strategy equilibria, such as SGD, Adam, and RMSProp, both in speed and quality.",

    "title": "Reinforced Pipeline Optimization: Behaving Optimally with Non-Differentiabilities",
    "abstract": "Many machine learning systems are implemented as pipelines. A pipeline is essentially a chain/network of information processing units. As information flows in and out and gradients vice versa, ideally, a pipeline can be trained end-to-end via backpropagation provided with the right supervision and loss function. However, this is usually impossible in practice, because either the loss function itself may be non-differentiable, or there may exist some non-differentiable units. One popular way to superficially resolve this issue is to separate a pipeline into a set of differentiable sub-pipelines and train them with isolated loss functions. Yet, from a decision-theoretical point of view, this is equivalent to making myopic decisions using ad hoc heuristics along the pipeline while ignoring the real utility, which prevents the pipeline from behaving optimally. In this paper, we show that by converting a pipeline into a stochastic counterpart, it can then be trained end-to-end in the presence of non-differentiable parts. Thus, the resulting pipeline is optimal under certain conditions with respect to any criterion attached to it. In experiments, we apply the proposed approach - reinforced pipeline optimization - to Faster R-CNN, a state-of-the-art object detection pipeline, and obtain empirically near-optimal object detectors consistent with its base design in terms of mean average precision.",

    "abstract": "Learning multiple tasks sequentially is important for the development of AI and lifelong learning systems. However, standard neural network architectures suffer from catastrophic forgetting which makes it difficult for them to learn a sequence of tasks. Several continual learning methods have been proposed to address the problem. In this paper, we propose a very different approach, called Parameter Generation and Model Adaptation (PGMA), to dealing with the problem. The proposed approach learns to build a model, called the solver, with two sets of parameters. The first set is shared by all tasks learned so far and the second set is dynamically generated to adapt the solver to suit each test example in order to classify it. Extensive experiments have been carried out to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.",

    "abstract": "Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are an effective framework for representation learning of graphs. GNNs follow a neighborhood aggregation scheme, where the representation vector of a node is computed by recursively aggregating and transforming representation vectors of its neighboring nodes. Many GNN variants have been proposed and have achieved state-of-the-art results on both node and graph classification tasks. However, despite GNNs revolutionizing graph representation learning, there is limited understanding of their representational properties and limitations. Here, we present a theoretical framework for analyzing the expressive power of GNNs to capture different graph structures. Our results characterize the discriminative power of popular GNN variants, such as Graph Convolutional Networks and GraphSAGE, and show that they cannot learn to distinguish certain simple graph structures. We then develop a simple architecture that is provably the most expressive among the class of GNNs and is as powerful as the Weisfeiler-Lehman graph isomorphism test. We empirically validate our theoretical findings on a number of graph classification benchmarks, and demonstrate that our model achieves state-of-the-art performance.",

    "abstract": "A Synaptic Neural Network (SynaNN) consists of synapses and neurons. Inspired by the synapse research of neuroscience, we built a synapse model with a nonlinear synapse function of excitatory and inhibitory channel probabilities. Introduced the concept of surprisal space and constructed a commutative diagram, we proved that the inhibitory probability function -log(1-exp(-x)) in surprisal space is the topologically conjugate function of the inhibitory complementary probability 1-x in probability space. Furthermore, we found that the derivative of the synapse over the parameter in the surprisal space is equal to the negative Bose-Einstein distribution. In addition, we constructed a fully connected synapse graph (tensor) as a synapse block of a synaptic neural network. Moreover, we proved the gradient formula of a cross-entropy loss function over parameters, so synapse learning can work with the gradient descent and backpropagation algorithms. In the proof-of-concept experiment, we performed an MNIST training and testing on the MLP model with synapse network as hidden layers.",

    "abstract": "Graphs are a prevalent tool in data science, as they model the inherent structure of the data. Typically they are constructed either by connecting nearest samples, or by learning them from data, solving an optimization problem. While graph learning does achieve a better quality, it also comes with a higher computational cost. In particular, the current state-of-the-art model cost is O(n^2) for n samples.\nIn this paper, we show how to scale it, obtaining an approximation with leading cost of O(n log(n)), with quality that approaches the exact graph learning model. Our algorithm uses known approximate nearest neighbor techniques to reduce the number of variables, and automatically selects the correct parameters of the model, requiring a single intuitive input: the desired edge density.",

    "abstract": "Reinforcement  Learning  (RL) problem can be solved in two different ways - the Value function-based approach and the policy optimization-based approach - to eventually arrive at an optimal policy for the given environment. One of the recent breakthroughs in reinforcement learning is the use of deep neural networks as function approximators to approximate the value function or q-function in a reinforcement learning scheme. This has led to results with agents automatically learning how to play games like alpha-go showing better-than-human performance. Deep Q-learning networks (DQN) and  Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) are two such methods that have shown state-of-the-art results in recent times. Among the many variants of RL, an important class of problems is where the state and action spaces are continuous --- autonomous robots, autonomous vehicles, optimal control are all examples of such problems that can lend themselves naturally to reinforcement based algorithms, and have continuous state and action spaces. In this paper, we adapt and combine approaches such as DQN and DDPG in novel ways to outperform the earlier results for continuous state and action space problems.  We believe these results are a valuable addition to the fast-growing body of results on Reinforcement Learning, more so for continuous state and action space problems.",

    "abstract": "In order to choose a neural network architecture that will be effective for a particular modeling problem, one must understand the limitations imposed by each of the potential options. These limitations are typically described in terms of information theoretic bounds, or by comparing the relative complexity needed to approximate example functions between different architectures. In this paper, we examine the topological constraints that the architecture of a neural network imposes on the level sets of all the functions that it is able to approximate. This approach is novel for both the nature of the limitations and the fact that they are independent of network depth for a broad family of activation functions.",

The approximation replaces a rank-4 gradient learning tensor, which describes how past hidden unit activations affect the current state, by a simple reduced-rank product of a sensitivity weight and a temporal eligibility trace. In this structured approximation motivated by node perturbation, the sensitivity weights and eligibility kernel time scales are themselves learned by applying perturbations. The rule represents another step toward biologically plausible or neurally inspired ML, with lower complexity in terms of relaxed architectural requirements (no symmetric return weights), a smaller memory demand (no unfolding and storage of states over time), and a shorter feedback time.

    "title": "MERCI: A NEW METRIC TO EVALUATE THE CORRELATION BETWEEN PREDICTIVE UNCERTAINTY AND TRUE ERROR",
    "abstract": "As deep learning applications are becoming more and more pervasive, the question of evaluating the reliability of a prediction becomes a central question in the machine learning community. This domain, known as predictive uncertainty, has come under the scrutiny of research groups developing Bayesian approaches to deep learning such as Monte Carlo Dropout. Unfortunately, for the time being, the real goal of predictive uncertainty has been swept under the rug. Indeed, Bayesian approaches are solely evaluated in terms of raw performance of the prediction, while the quality of the estimated uncertainty is not assessed. One contribution of this article is to draw attention on existing metrics developed in the forecast community, designed to evaluate both the sharpness and the calibration of predictive uncertainty. Sharpness refers to the concentration of the predictive distributions and calibration to the consistency between the predicted uncertainty level and the actual errors. We further analyze the behavior of these metrics on regression problems when deep convolutional networks are involved and for several current predictive uncertainty approaches. A second contribution of this article is to propose an alternative metric that is more adapted to the evaluation of relative uncertainty assessment and directly applicable to regression with deep learning. This metric is evaluated and compared with existing ones on a toy dataset as well as on the problem of monocular depth estimation. ",

    "abstract": "Adversarial training has been successfully applied to build robust models at a certain cost. While the robustness of a model increases, the standard classification accuracy declines. This phenomenon is suggested to be an inherent trade-off. We propose a model that employs feature prioritization by a nonlinear attention module and $L_2$ feature regularization to improve the adversarial robustness and the standard accuracy relative to adversarial training. The attention module encourages the model to rely heavily on robust features by assigning larger weights to them while suppressing non-robust features. The regularizer encourages the model to extracts similar features for the natural and adversarial images, effectively ignoring the added perturbation. In addition to evaluating the robustness of our model, we provide justification for the attention module and propose a novel experimental strategy that quantitatively demonstrates that our model is almost ideally aligned with salient data characteristics. Additional experimental results illustrate the power of our model relative to the state of the art methods.",

    "title": "Teacher Guided Architecture Search",
    "abstract": "Strong improvements in neural network performance in vision tasks have resulted from the search of alternative network architectures, and prior work has shown that this search process can be automated and guided by evaluating candidate network performance following limited training (“Performance Guided Architecture Search” or PGAS).  However, because of the large architecture search spaces and the high computational cost associated with evaluating each candidate model, further gains in computational efficiency are needed.  Here we present a method termed Teacher Guided Search for Architectures by Generation and Evaluation (TG-SAGE) that produces up to an order of magnitude in search efficiency over PGAS methods. Specifically, TG-SAGE guides each step of the architecture search by evaluating the similarity of internal representations of the candidate networks with those of the (fixed) teacher network. We show that this procedure leads to significant reduction in required per-sample training and that, this advantage holds for two different search spaces of architectures, and two different search algorithms. We further show that in the space of convolutional cells for visual categorization, TG-SAGE finds a cell structure with similar performance as was previously found using other methods but at a total computational cost that is two orders of magnitude lower than Neural Architecture Search (NAS) and more than four times lower than progressive neural architecture search (PNAS). These results suggest that TG-SAGE can be used to accelerate network architecture search in cases where one has access to some or all of the internal representations of a teacher network of interest, such as the brain.

    "abstract": "Deep latent variable models have seen recent success in many data domains. Lossless compression is an application of these models which, despite having the potential to be highly useful, has yet to be implemented in a practical manner. We present '`Bits Back with ANS' (BB-ANS), a scheme to perform lossless compression with latent variable models at a near optimal rate. We demonstrate this scheme by using it to compress the MNIST dataset with a variational auto-encoder model (VAE), achieving compression rates superior to standard methods with only a simple VAE. Given that the scheme is highly amenable to parallelization, we conclude that with a sufficiently high quality generative model this scheme could be used to achieve substantial improvements in compression rate with acceptable running time. We make our implementation available open source at https://github.com/bits-back/bits-back .",

    "abstract": "We present a meta-learning approach for adaptive text-to-speech (TTS) with few data. During training, we learn a multi-speaker model using a shared conditional WaveNet core and independent learned embeddings for each speaker. The aim of training is not to produce a neural network with fixed weights, which is then deployed as a TTS system. Instead, the aim is to produce a network that requires few data at deployment time to rapidly adapt to new speakers. We introduce and benchmark three strategies:\n(i) learning the speaker embedding while keeping the WaveNet core fixed,\n(ii) fine-tuning the entire architecture with stochastic gradient descent, and\n(iii) predicting the speaker embedding with a trained neural network encoder.\nThe experiments show that these approaches are successful at adapting the multi-speaker neural network to new speakers, obtaining state-of-the-art results in both sample naturalness and voice similarity with merely a few minutes of audio data from new speakers.",

    "abstract": "Generalization from limited examples, usually studied under the umbrella of meta-learning, equips learning techniques with the ability to adapt quickly in dynamical environments and proves to be an essential aspect of lifelong learning. In this paper, we introduce the Projective Subspace Networks (PSN), a deep learning paradigm that learns non-linear embeddings from limited supervision. In contrast to previous studies, the embedding in PSN deems samples of a given class to form an affine subspace. We will show that such modeling leads to robust solutions, yielding competitive results on supervised and semi-supervised few-shot classification. Moreover, our PSN approach has the ability of end-to-end learning. In contrast to previous works, our projective subspace can be thought of as a richer representation capturing higher-order information datapoints for modeling new concepts.",

    "title": "FAST OBJECT LOCALIZATION VIA SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS",
    "abstract": "Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have been repeatedly shown to perform well on image classification tasks, successfully recognizing a broad array of objects when given sufficient training data. Methods for object localization, however, are still in need of substantial improvement. Common approaches to this problem involve the use of a sliding window, sometimes at multiple scales, providing input to a deep CNN trained to classify the contents of the window. In general, these approaches are time consuming, requiring many classification calculations. In this paper, we offer a fundamentally different approach to the localization of recognized objects in images. Our method is predicated on the idea that a deep CNN capable of recognizing an object must implicitly contain knowledge about object location in its connection weights. We provide a simple method to interpret classifier weights in the context of individual classified images. This method involves the calculation of the derivative of network generated activation patterns, such as the activation of output class label units, with regard to each in- put pixel, performing a sensitivity analysis that identifies the pixels that, in a local sense, have the greatest influence on internal representations and object recognition. These derivatives can be efficiently computed using a single backward pass through the deep CNN classifier, producing a sensitivity map of the image. We demonstrate that a simple linear mapping can be learned from sensitivity maps to bounding box coordinates, localizing the recognized object. Our experimental results, using real-world data sets for which ground truth localization information is known, reveal competitive accuracy from our fast technique.",

    "abstract": "Distributed optimization is vital in solving large-scale machine learning problems. A widely-shared feature of distributed optimization techniques is the requirement that all nodes complete their assigned tasks in each computational epoch before the system can proceed to the next epoch. In such settings, slow nodes, called stragglers, can greatly slow progress. To mitigate the impact of stragglers, we propose an online distributed optimization method called Anytime Minibatch. In this approach, all nodes are given a fixed time to compute the gradients of as many data samples as possible. The result is a variable per-node minibatch size. Workers then get a fixed communication time to average their minibatch gradients via several rounds of consensus, which are then used to update primal variables via dual averaging. Anytime Minibatch prevents stragglers from holding up the system without wasting the work that stragglers can complete. We present a convergence analysis and analyze the wall time performance. Our numerical results show that our approach is up to 1.5 times faster in Amazon EC2 and it is up to five times faster when there is greater variability in compute node performance.",

    "abstract": "We present a deep learning-based method for super-resolving coarse (low-resolution) labels assigned to groups of image pixels into pixel-level (high-resolution) labels, given the joint distribution between those low- and high-resolution labels. This method involves a novel loss function that minimizes the distance between a distribution determined by a set of model outputs and the corresponding distribution given by low-resolution labels over the same set of outputs. This setup does not require that the high-resolution classes match the low-resolution classes and can be used in high-resolution semantic segmentation tasks where high-resolution labeled data is not available. Furthermore, our proposed method is able to utilize both data with low-resolution labels and any available high-resolution labels, which we show improves performance compared to a network trained only with the same amount of high-resolution data.\nWe test our proposed algorithm in a challenging land cover mapping task to super-resolve labels at a 30m resolution to a separate set of labels at a 1m resolution. We compare our algorithm with models that are trained on high-resolution data and show that 1) we can achieve similar performance using only low-resolution data; and 2) we can achieve better performance when we incorporate a small amount of high-resolution data in our training. We also test our approach on a medical imaging problem, resolving low-resolution probability maps into high-resolution segmentation of lymphocytes with accuracy equal to that of fully supervised models.",

    "title": "Generating Multi-Agent Trajectories using Programmatic Weak Supervision",
    "abstract": "We study the problem of training sequential generative models for capturing coordinated multi-agent trajectory behavior, such as  offensive basketball gameplay.  When modeling such settings, it is often beneficial to design hierarchical models that can capture long-term coordination using intermediate variables.  Furthermore, these intermediate variables should capture interesting high-level behavioral semantics in an interpretable and manipulable way. We present a hierarchical framework that can effectively learn such sequential generative models.  Our approach is inspired by recent work on leveraging programmatically produced weak labels, which we extend to the spatiotemporal regime. In addition to synthetic settings, we show how to instantiate our framework to effectively model complex interactions between basketball players and generate realistic multi-agent trajectories of basketball gameplay over long time periods. We validate our approach using both quantitative and qualitative evaluations, including a user study comparison conducted with professional sports analysts.",

    "title": "Learning models for visual 3D localization with implicit mapping",
    "abstract": "We consider learning based methods for visual localization that do not require the construction of explicit maps in the form of point clouds or voxels. The goal is to learn an implicit representation of the environment at a higher, more abstract level, for instance that of objects. We propose to use a generative approach based on Generative Query Networks (GQNs, Eslami et al. 2018), asking the following questions: 1) Can GQN capture more complex scenes than those it was originally demonstrated on? 2) Can GQN be used for localization in those scenes? To study this approach we consider procedurally generated Minecraft worlds, for which we can generate images of complex 3D scenes along with camera pose coordinates. We first show that GQNs, enhanced with a novel attention mechanism can capture the structure of 3D scenes in Minecraft, as evidenced by their samples. We then apply the models to the localization problem, comparing the results to a discriminative baseline, and comparing the ways each approach captures the task uncertainty. ",

    "title": "Understanding & Generalizing AlphaGo Zero",
    "abstract": "AlphaGo Zero (AGZ) introduced a new {\\em tabula rasa} reinforcement learning algorithm that has achieved superhuman performance in the games of Go, Chess, and Shogi with no prior knowledge other than the rules of the game. This success naturally begs the question whether it is possible to develop similar high-performance reinforcement learning algorithms for generic sequential decision-making problems (beyond two-player games), using only the constraints of the environment as the ``rules.'' To address this challenge, we start by taking steps towards developing a formal understanding of AGZ.  AGZ includes two key innovations: (1) it learns a policy (represented as a neural network) using {\\em supervised learning} with cross-entropy loss from samples generated via Monte-Carlo Tree Search (MCTS); (2) it uses {\\em self-play} to learn without training data. \n\nWe argue that the self-play in AGZ corresponds to learning a Nash equilibrium for the two-player game; and the supervised learning with MCTS is attempting to learn the policy corresponding to the Nash equilibrium, by establishing a novel bound on the difference between the expected return achieved by two policies in terms of the expected KL divergence (cross-entropy) of their induced distributions. To extend AGZ to generic sequential decision-making problems, we introduce a {\\em robust MDP} framework, in which the agent and nature effectively play a zero-sum game: the agent aims to take actions to maximize reward while nature seeks state transitions, subject to the constraints of that environment, that minimize the agent's reward. For a challenging network scheduling domain, we find that AGZ within the robust MDP framework provides near-optimal performance, matching one of the best known scheduling policies that has taken the networking community three decades of intensive research to develop.\n",

    "title": "Perfect Match: A Simple Method for Learning Representations For Counterfactual Inference With Neural Networks",
    "abstract": "Learning representations for counterfactual inference from observational data is of high practical relevance for many domains, such as healthcare, public policy and economics. Counterfactual inference enables one to answer \"What if...?\" questions, such as \"What would be the outcome if we gave this patient treatment $t_1$?\". However, current methods for training neural networks for counterfactual inference on observational data are either overly complex, limited to settings with only two available treatment options, or both. Here, we present Perfect Match (PM), a method for training neural networks for counterfactual inference that is easy to implement, compatible with any architecture, does not add computational complexity or hyperparameters, and extends to any number of treatments. PM is based on the idea of augmenting samples within a minibatch with their propensity-matched nearest neighbours. Our experiments demonstrate that PM outperforms a number of more complex state-of-the-art methods in inferring counterfactual outcomes across several real-world and semi-synthetic datasets.",

    "title": "Learning Disentangled Representations with Reference-Based Variational Autoencoders",
    "abstract": "Learning disentangled representations from visual data, where different high-level generative factors are independently encoded, is of importance for many computer vision tasks. Supervised approaches, however, require a significant annotation effort in order to label the factors of interest in a training set. To alleviate the annotation cost, we introduce a learning setting which we refer to as \"reference-based disentangling''. Given a pool of unlabelled images, the goal is to learn a representation where a set of target factors are disentangled from others. The only supervision comes from an auxiliary  \"reference set'' that contains  images where the factors of interest are constant. In order to address this problem, we propose reference-based variational autoencoders, a novel deep generative model designed to exploit the weak supervisory signal provided by the reference set. During training, we use the variational inference framework where adversarial learning is used to minimize the objective function. By addressing tasks such as feature learning, conditional image generation or attribute transfer, we validate the ability of the proposed model to learn disentangled representations from minimal supervision.\n\n",

    "title": "SPIGAN: Privileged Adversarial Learning from Simulation",
    "abstract": "Deep Learning for Computer Vision depends mainly on the source of supervision. Photo-realistic simulators can generate large-scale automatically labeled synthetic data, but introduce a domain gap negatively impacting performance. We propose a new unsupervised domain adaptation algorithm, called SPIGAN, relying on Simulator Privileged Information (PI) and Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN). We use internal data from the simulator as PI during the training of a target task network. We experimentally evaluate our approach on semantic segmentation. We train the networks on real-world Cityscapes and Vistas datasets, using only unlabeled real-world images and synthetic labeled data with z-buffer (depth) PI from the SYNTHIA dataset. Our method improves over no adaptation and state-of-the-art unsupervised domain adaptation techniques.",

    "title": "Incremental Few-Shot Learning with Attention Attractor Networks",
    "abstract": "Machine learning classifiers are often trained to recognize a set of pre-defined classes. However,\nin many real applications, it is often desirable to have the flexibility of learning additional\nconcepts, without re-training on the full training set. This paper addresses this problem,\nincremental few-shot learning, where a regular classification network has already been trained to\nrecognize a set of base classes; and several extra novel classes are being considered, each with\nonly a few labeled examples. After learning the novel classes, the model is then evaluated on the\noverall performance of both base and novel classes. To this end, we propose a meta-learning model,\nthe Attention Attractor Network, which regularizes the learning of novel classes. In each episode,\nwe train a set of new weights to recognize novel classes until they converge, and we show that the\ntechnique of recurrent back-propagation can back-propagate through the optimization process and\nfacilitate the learning of the attractor network regularizer. We demonstrate that the learned\nattractor network can recognize novel classes while remembering old classes without the need to\nreview the original training set, outperforming baselines that do not rely on an iterative\noptimization process.",

    "title": "Learning from Noisy Demonstration Sets via Meta-Learned Suitability Assessor",
    "abstract": "A noisy and diverse demonstration set may hinder the performances of an agent aiming to acquire certain skills via imitation learning. However, state-of-the-art imitation learning algorithms often assume the optimality of the given demonstration set.\nIn this paper, we address such optimal assumption by learning only from the most suitable demonstrations in a given set. Suitability of a demonstration is estimated by whether imitating it produce desirable outcomes for achieving the goals of the tasks. For more efficient demonstration suitability assessments, the learning agent should be capable of imitating a demonstration as quick as possible, which shares similar spirit with fast adaptation in the meta-learning regime. Our framework, thus built on top of Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning, evaluates how desirable the imitated outcomes are, after adaptation to each demonstration in the set.

    "title": "Transfer Learning for Related Reinforcement Learning Tasks via Image-to-Image Translation",
    "abstract": "Deep Reinforcement Learning has managed to achieve state-of-the-art results in learning control policies directly from raw pixels. However, despite its remarkable success, it fails to generalize, a fundamental component required in a stable Artificial Intelligence system. Using the Atari game Breakout, we demonstrate the difficulty of a trained agent in adjusting to simple modifications in the raw image, ones that a human could adapt to trivially. In transfer learning, the goal is to use the knowledge gained from the source task to make the training of the target task faster and better. We show that using various forms of fine-tuning, a common method for transfer learning, is not effective for adapting to such small visual changes. In fact, it is often easier to re-train the agent from scratch than to fine-tune a trained agent. We suggest that in some cases transfer learning can be improved by adding a dedicated component whose goal is to learn to visually map between the known domain and the new one. Concretely, we use Unaligned Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to create a mapping function to translate images in the target task to corresponding images in the source task. These mapping functions allow us to transform between various variations of the Breakout game, as well as between different levels of a Nintendo game, Road Fighter. We show that learning this mapping is substantially more efficient than re-training. A visualization of a trained agent playing Breakout and Road Fighter, with and without the GAN transfer, can be seen in \\url{https://streamable.com/msgtm} and \\url{https://streamable.com/5e2ka}.",

    "title": "An Active Learning Framework for Efficient Robust Policy Search",
    "abstract": "Robust Policy Search is the problem of learning policies that do not degrade in performance when subject to unseen environment model parameters. It is particularly relevant for transferring policies learned in a simulation environment to the real world. Several existing approaches involve sampling large batches of trajectories which reflect the differences in various possible environments, and then selecting some subset of these to learn robust policies, such as the ones that  result in the worst performance. We propose an active learning based framework, EffAcTS, to selectively choose model parameters for this purpose so as to collect only as much data as necessary to select such a subset. We apply this framework to an existing method, namely EPOpt, and experimentally validate the gains in sample efficiency and the performance of our approach on standard continuous control tasks. We also present a Multi-Task Learning perspective to the problem of Robust Policy Search, and draw connections from our proposed framework to existing work on Multi-Task Learning.",

    "abstract": "A new statistical procedure (Candès,2018) has provided a way to identify important factors using any supervised learning method controlling for FDR. This line of research has shown great potential to expand the horizon of machine learning methods beyond the task of prediction, to serve the broader need for scientific researches for interpretable findings. However, the lack of a practical and flexible method to generate knockoffs remains the major obstacle for wide application of  Model-X procedure. This paper fills in the gap by proposing a model-free knockoff generator which approximates the correlation structure between features through latent variable representation. We demonstrate our proposed method can achieve FDR control and better power than two existing methods in various simulated settings and a real data example for finding mutations associated with drug resistance in HIV-1 patients.\n\n",

Due to the large number of parameters of machine learning problems, full-matrix preconditioning methods are prohibitively expensive. We show how to modify full-matrix adaptive regularization in order to make it practical and effective. We also provide novel theoretical analysis\nfor adaptive regularization in non-convex optimization settings. The core of our algorithm, termed GGT, consists of efficient inverse computation of square roots of low-rank matrices. Our preliminary experiments underscore improved convergence rate of GGT across a variety of synthetic tasks and standard deep learning benchmarks.",

    "abstract": "Reinforcement learning agents need exploratory behaviors to escape from local optima. These behaviors may include both immediate dithering perturbation and temporally consistent exploration. To achieve these, a stochastic policy model that is inherently consistent through a period of time is in desire, especially for tasks with either sparse rewards or long term information. In this work, we introduce a novel on-policy temporally consistent exploration strategy - Neural Adaptive Dropout Policy Exploration (NADPEx) - for deep reinforcement learning agents. Modeled as a global random variable for conditional distribution, dropout is incorporated to reinforcement learning policies, equipping them with inherent temporal consistency, even when the reward signals are sparse. Two factors, gradients' alignment with the objective and KL constraint in policy space, are discussed to guarantee NADPEx policy's stable improvement. Our experiments demonstrate that NADPEx solves tasks with sparse reward while naive exploration and parameter noise fail. It yields as well or even faster convergence in the standard mujoco benchmark for continuous control. ",

    "abstract": "Variational Bayesian neural networks (BNN) perform variational inference over weights, but it is difficult to specify meaningful priors and approximating posteriors in a high-dimensional weight space. We introduce functional variational Bayesian neural networks (fBNNs), which maximize an Evidence Lower BOund (ELBO) defined directly on stochastic processes, i.e. distributions over functions. We prove that the KL divergence between stochastic processes is equal to the supremum of marginal KL divergences over all finite sets of inputs. Based on this, we introduce a practical training objective which approximates the functional ELBO using finite measurement sets and the spectral Stein gradient estimator. With fBNNs, we can specify priors which entail rich structure, including Gaussian processes and implicit stochastic processes. Empirically, we find that fBNNs extrapolate well using various structured priors, provide reliable uncertainty estimates, and can scale to large datasets.",

    "abstract": "The high computational and parameter complexity of neural networks makes their training very slow and difficult to deploy on energy and storage-constrained comput- ing systems. Many network complexity reduction techniques have been proposed including fixed-point implementation. However, a systematic approach for design- ing full fixed-point training and inference of deep neural networks remains elusive. We describe a precision assignment methodology for neural network training in which all network parameters, i.e., activations and weights in the feedforward path, gradients and weight accumulators in the feedback path, are assigned close to minimal precision. The precision assignment is derived analytically and enables tracking the convergence behavior of the full precision training, known to converge a priori. Thus, our work leads to a systematic methodology of determining suit- able precision for fixed-point training. The near optimality (minimality) of the resulting precision assignment is validated empirically for four networks on the CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and SVHN datasets. The complexity reduction arising from our approach is compared with other fixed-point neural network designs.",

    "abstract": "Batch Normalization (BN) has become a cornerstone of deep learning across diverse architectures, appearing to help optimization as well as generalization. While the idea makes intuitive sense, theoretical analysis of its effectiveness has been lacking. Here theoretical support is provided for one of its conjectured properties, namely, the ability to allow gradient descent to succeed with less tuning of learning rates. It is shown that even if we fix the learning rate of scale-invariant parameters (e.g., weights of each layer with BN) to a constant (say, 0.3), gradient descent still approaches a stationary point (i.e., a solution where gradient is zero) in the rate of T^{−1/2} in T iterations, asymptotically matching the best bound for gradient descent with well-tuned learning rates. A similar result with convergence rate T^{−1/4} is also shown for stochastic gradient descent.",

    "abstract": "Data parallelism has become a dominant method to scale Deep Neural Network (DNN) training across multiple nodes.  Since the synchronization of the local models or gradients can be a bottleneck for large-scale distributed training, compressing communication traffic has gained widespread attention recently.  Among several recent proposed compression algorithms, \nResidual Gradient Compression (RGC) is one of the most successful approaches---it can significantly compress the transmitting message size (0.1% of the gradient size) of each node and still preserve accuracy. However, the literature on compressing deep networks focuses almost exclusively on achieving good compression rate, while the efficiency of RGC in real implementation has been less investigated. In this paper, we develop an RGC method that achieves significant training time improvement in real-world multi-GPU systems. Our proposed RGC system design called RedSync, introduces a set of optimizations to reduce communication bandwidth while introducing limited overhead. We examine the performance of RedSync on two different multiple GPU platforms, including a supercomputer and a multi-card server. Our test cases include image classification on Cifar10 and ImageNet, and language modeling tasks on Penn Treebank and Wiki2 datasets. For DNNs featured with high communication to computation ratio, which has long been considered with poor scalability, RedSync shows significant performance improvement.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we consider the problem of learning a policy by observing numerous non-expert agents. Our goal is to extract a policy that, with high-confidence, acts better than the agents' average performance. Such a setting is important for real-world problems where expert data is scarce but non-expert data can easily be obtained, e.g. by crowdsourcing. Our approach is to pose this problem as safe policy improvement in reinforcement learning. First, we evaluate an average behavior policy and approximate its value function. Then, we develop a stochastic policy improvement algorithm that safely improves the average behavior. The primary advantages of our approach, termed Rerouted Behavior Improvement (RBI), over other safe learning methods are its stability in the presence of value estimation errors and the elimination of a policy search process.  We demonstrate these advantages in the Taxi grid-world domain and in four games from the Atari learning environment.",

    "title": "Recurrent Kalman Networks: Factorized Inference in High-Dimensional Deep Feature Spaces",
    "abstract": "In order to integrate uncertainty estimates into deep time-series modelling, Kalman Filters (KFs) (Kalman et al., 1960) have been integrated with deep learning models. Yet, such approaches typically rely on approximate inference techniques such as variational inference which makes learning more complex and often less scalable due to approximation errors. We propose a new deep approach to Kalman filtering which can be learned directly in an end-to-end manner using backpropagation without additional approximations. Our approach uses a high-dimensional factorized latent state representation for which the Kalman updates simplify to scalar operations and thus avoids hard to backpropagate, computationally heavy and potentially unstable matrix inversions. Moreover, we use locally linear dynamic models to efficiently propagate the latent state to the next time\nstep. While our locally linear modelling and factorization assumptions are in general not true for the original low-dimensional state space of the system, the network finds a high-dimensional latent space where these assumptions hold to perform efficient inference. This state representation is learned jointly with the transition and noise models. The resulting network architecture, which we call Recurrent Kalman Network (RKN), can be used for any time-series data, similar to a LSTM (Hochreiter and Schmidhuber, 1997) but uses an explicit representation of uncertainty. As shown by our experiments, the RKN obtains much more accurate uncertainty estimates than an LSTM or Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs) (Cho et al., 2014) while also showing a slightly improved prediction performance and outperforms various recent generative models on an image imputation task.",

    "abstract": "In recent years, softmax together with its fast approximations has become the de-facto loss function for deep neural networks with multiclass predictions. However, softmax is used in many problems that do not fully fit the multiclass framework and where the softmax assumption of mutually exclusive outcomes can lead to biased results. This is often the case for applications such as language modeling, next event prediction and matrix factorization, where many of the potential outcomes are not mutually exclusive, but are more likely to be independent conditionally on the state. To this end, for the set of problems with positive and unlabeled data, we propose a relaxation of the original softmax formulation, where, given the observed state, each of the outcomes are conditionally independent but share a common set of negatives. Since we operate in a regime where explicit negatives are missing, we create an adversarially-trained model of negatives and derive a new negative sampling and weighting scheme which we denote as Cooperative Importance Sampling (CIS). We show empirically the advantages of our newly introduced negative sampling scheme by pluging it in the Word2Vec algorithm and benching it extensively against other negative sampling schemes on both language modeling and matrix factorization tasks and show large lifts in performance.",

DGI relies on maximizing mutual information between patch representations and corresponding high-level summaries of graphs---both derived using established graph convolutional network architectures. The learnt patch representations summarize subgraphs centered around nodes of interest, and can thus be reused for downstream node-wise learning tasks. In contrast to most prior approaches to unsupervised learning with GCNs, DGI does not rely on random walk objectives, and is readily applicable to both transductive and inductive learning setups. We demonstrate competitive performance on a variety of node classification benchmarks, which at times even exceeds the performance of supervised learning.",

This discovery allows us to pick any model from this family after training, which leads to a substantial improvement on regularisation-heavy language modelling. The family includes models that compute a power mean over the sampled dropout masks, and their less stochastic subvariants with tighter and higher lower bounds than the fully stochastic dropout objective. We argue that since the deterministic subvariant's bound is equal to its objective, and the highest amongst these models, the predominant view of it as a good approximation to MC averaging is misleading. Rather, deterministic dropout is the best available approximation to the true objective.",

Towards this goal, we introduce a number of key ideas from traditional algorithms and complexity theory. First, we draw a new connection between primal-dual methods and reinforcement learning. Next, we introduce the concept of adversarial distributions (universal and high-entropy training sets), which are distributions that encourage the learner to find algorithms that work well in the worst case. We test our new ideas on a number of optimization problem such as the AdWords problem, the online knapsack problem, and the secretary problem. Our results indicate that the models have learned behaviours that are consistent with the traditional optimal algorithms for these problems.",

In this paper, we consider a challenging setting where an agent has access to a sparse reward function and state-only expert observations. We propose a method which gradually balances between the imitation learning cost and the reinforcement learning objective. Built upon an existing imitation learning method, our approach works with state-only observations. We show, through navigation scenarios, that (i) an agent is able to efficiently leverage sparse rewards to outperform standard state-only imitation learning, (ii) it can learn a policy even when learner's actions are different from the expert, and (iii) the performance of the agent is not bounded by that of the expert due to the optimized usage of sparse rewards.",

    "abstract": "Large-scale datasets may contain significant proportions of noisy (incorrect) class labels, and it is well-known that modern deep neural networks poorly generalize from such noisy training datasets.   In this paper,  we propose a novel inference method, Deep Determinantal Generative Classifier (DDGC), which can obtain a more robust decision boundary under any softmax neural classifier pre-trained on noisy datasets. Our main idea is inducing a generative classifier on top of hidden feature spaces of the discriminative deep model. By estimating the parameters of generative classifier using the minimum covariance determinant estimator, we significantly improve the classification accuracy, with neither re-training of the deep model nor changing its architectures. In particular, we show that DDGC not only generalizes well from noisy labels, but also is robust against adversarial perturbations due to its large margin property. Finally, we propose the ensemble version ofDDGC to improve its performance, by investigating the layer-wise characteristics of generative classifier.  Our extensive experimental results demonstrate the superiority of DDGC given different learning models optimized by various training techniques to handle noisy labels or adversarial samples. For instance, on CIFAR-10 dataset containing 45% noisy training labels, we improve the test accuracy of a deep model optimized by the state-of-the-art noise-handling training method from33.34% to 43.02%.",

Decades of research and engineering went into designing fast iterative solution methods. Existing solvers are general purpose, but may be sub-optimal for specific classes of problems. In contrast to existing hand-crafted solutions, we propose an approach to learn a fast iterative solver tailored to a specific domain. We achieve this goal by learning to modify the updates of an existing solver using a deep neural network. Crucially, our approach is proven to preserve strong correctness and convergence guarantees. After training on a single geometry, our model generalizes to a wide variety of geometries and boundary conditions, and achieves 2-3 times speedup compared to state-of-the-art solvers.",

Our contribution is threefold. First, geomstats allows the flexible modeling of many a machine learning problem through an efficient and extensively unit-tested implementations of these manifolds, as well as the set of useful Riemannian metrics, exponential and logarithm maps that we provide. Moreover, the wide choice of loss functions and our implementation of the corresponding gradients allow fast and easy optimization over manifolds. Finally, geomstats is the only package to provide a unified framework for Riemannian geometry, as the operations implemented in geomstats are available with different computing backends (numpy,tensorflow and keras), as well as with a GPU-enabled mode–-thus considerably facilitating the application of Riemannian geometry in machine learning. In this paper, we present geomstats through a review of the utility and advantages of manifolds in machine learning, using the concrete examples that they span to show the efficiency and practicality of their implementation using our package",

    "abstract": "The ability to predict matches between two sources of text has a number of applications including natural language inference (NLI) and question answering (QA). While flexible neural models have become effective tools in solving these tasks, they are rarely transparent in terms of the mechanism that mediates the prediction. In this paper, we propose a self-explaining architecture where the model is forced to highlight, in a dependent manner, how spans of one side of the input match corresponding segments of the other side in order to arrive at the overall decision. The text spans are regularized to be coherent and concise, and their correspondence is captured explicitly. The text spans -- rationales -- are learned entirely as latent mechanisms, guided only by the distal supervision from the end-to-end task. We evaluate our model on both NLI and QA using three publicly available datasets.  Experimental results demonstrate quantitatively and qualitatively that our method delivers interpretable justification of the prediction without sacrificing state-of-the-art performance. Our code and data split will be publicly available. ",

    "abstract": "Derivative-free optimization (DFO) using trust region methods is frequently used for machine learning applications, such as (hyper-)parameter optimization without the derivatives of objective functions known.  Inspired by the recent work in continuous-time minimizers, our work models the common trust region methods with the exploration-exploitation using a dynamical system coupling a pair of dynamical processes. While the first exploration process searches the minimum of the blackbox function through minimizing a time-evolving surrogation function, another exploitation process updates the surrogation function time-to-time using the points traversed by the exploration process. The efficiency of derivative-free optimization thus depends on ways the two processes couple. In this paper, we propose a novel dynamical system, namely \\ThePrev---\\underline{S}tochastic \\underline{H}amiltonian \\underline{E}xploration and \\underline{E}xploitation, that surrogates the subregions of blackbox function using a time-evolving quadratic function, then explores and tracks the minimum of the quadratic functions using a fast-converging Hamiltonian system. The \\ThePrev\\ algorithm is later provided as a discrete-time numerical approximation to the system. To further accelerate optimization, we present \\TheName\\ that parallelizes multiple \\ThePrev\\ threads for concurrent exploration and exploitation. Experiment results based on a wide range of machine learning applications show that \\TheName\\ outperform a boarder range of derivative-free optimization algorithms with faster convergence speed under the same settings.",

    "abstract": "Humans are capable of attributing latent mental contents such as beliefs, or intentions to others. The social skill is critical in everyday life to reason about the potential consequences of their behaviors so as to plan ahead. It is known that humans use this reasoning ability recursively, i.e. considering what others believe about their own beliefs.  In this paper, we start  from level-$1$ recursion and introduce a probabilistic recursive reasoning (PR2) framework for multi-agent reinforcement learning. Our hypothesis is that it is beneficial for each agent to account for how the opponents would react to its future behaviors. Under the PR2 framework, we adopt variational Bayes methods to approximate the opponents' conditional policy, to which each agent finds the  best response and then improve their own policy. We develop  decentralized-training-decentralized-execution  algorithms, PR2-Q and PR2-Actor-Critic, that are proved to converge in the self-play scenario when there is one Nash equilibrium. Our methods are tested on both the matrix game and the differential game, which have a non-trivial equilibrium where common gradient-based methods fail to converge. Our experiments show that it is critical to reason about how the opponents believe about what the agent believes. We expect our work to contribute a new idea of modeling the opponents to the multi-agent reinforcement learning community.  \n",

    "abstract": "We study the problem of designing provably optimal adversarial noise algorithms that induce misclassification in settings where a learner aggregates decisions from multiple classifiers. Given the demonstrated vulnerability of state-of-the-art models to adversarial examples, recent efforts within the field of robust machine learning have focused on the use of ensemble classifiers as a way of boosting the robustness of individual models. In this paper, we design provably optimal attacks against a set of classifiers. We demonstrate how this problem can be framed as finding strategies at equilibrium in a two player, zero sum game between a learner and an adversary and consequently illustrate the need for randomization in adversarial attacks. The main technical challenge we consider is the design of best response oracles that can be implemented in a Multiplicative Weight Updates framework to find equilibrium strategies in the zero-sum game. We develop a series of scalable noise generation algorithms for deep neural networks, and show that it outperforms state-of-the-art attacks on various image classification tasks. Although there are generally no guarantees for deep learning, we show this is a well-principled approach in that it is provably optimal for linear classifiers. The main insight is a geometric characterization of the decision space that reduces the problem of designing best response oracles to minimizing a quadratic function over a set of convex polytopes.",

    "abstract": "Principal Filter Analysis (PFA) is an easy to implement, yet effective method for neural network compression. PFA exploits the intrinsic correlation between filter responses within network layers to recommend a smaller network footprint. We propose two compression algorithms: the first allows a user to specify the proportion of the original spectral energy that should be preserved in each layer after compression, while the second is a heuristic that leads to a parameter-free approach that automatically selects the compression used at each layer. Both algorithms are evaluated against several architectures and datasets, and we show considerable compression rates without compromising accuracy, e.g., for VGG-16 on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 and ImageNet, PFA achieves a compression rate of 8x, 3x, and 1.4x with an accuracy gain of 0.4%, 1.4% points, and 2.4% respectively. In our tests we also demonstrate that networks compressed with PFA achieve an accuracy that is very close to the empirical upper bound for a given compression ratio. Finally, we show how PFA is an effective tool for simultaneous compression and domain adaptation.",

While these models are powerful at making predictions, the representational form is rather crude and does not provide insights into linguistic structures. In this paper we introduce novel language models with representations informed by the framework of Holographic Reduced Representation (HRR). This allows us to inject structures directly into our word-level and chunk-level representations. Our analyses show that by using HRR as a structured compositional representation, our models are able to discover crude linguistic roles, which roughly resembles a classic division between syntax and semantics.",

CWAE cost function, based on introduced Cramer-Wold distance between samples, has a simple closed-form in the case of normal prior. As a consequence, while simplifying the optimization procedure (no need of sampling necessary to evaluate the distance function in the training loop), CWAE performance matches quantitatively and qualitatively that of WAE-MMD (WAE using maximum mean discrepancy based distance function) and often improves upon SWAE.",

    "title": "Compound Density Networks",
    "abstract": "Despite the huge success of deep neural networks (NNs), finding good mechanisms for quantifying their prediction uncertainty is still an open problem. It was recently shown, that using an ensemble of NNs trained with a proper scoring rule leads to results competitive to those of Bayesian NNs. This ensemble method can be understood as finite mixture model with uniform mixing weights. We build on this mixture model approach and increase its flexibility by replacing the fixed mixing weights by an adaptive, input-dependent distribution (specifying the probability of each component) represented by an NN, and by considering uncountably many mixture components. The resulting model can be seen as the continuous counterpart to mixture density networks and is therefore referred to as compound density network. We empirically show that the proposed model results in better uncertainty estimates and is more robust to adversarial examples than previous approaches.",

    "title": "Dirichlet Variational Autoencoder",
    "abstract": "This paper proposes Dirichlet Variational Autoencoder (DirVAE) using a Dirichlet prior for a continuous latent variable that exhibits the characteristic of the categorical probabilities. To infer the parameters of DirVAE, we utilize the stochastic gradient method by approximating the Gamma distribution, which is a component of the Dirichlet distribution, with the inverse Gamma CDF approximation. Additionally, we reshape the component collapsing issue by investigating two problem sources, which are decoder weight collapsing and latent value collapsing, and we show that DirVAE has no component collapsing; while Gaussian VAE exhibits the decoder weight collapsing and Stick-Breaking VAE shows the latent value collapsing. The experimental results show that 1) DirVAE models the latent representation result with the best log-likelihood compared to the baselines; and 2) DirVAE produces more interpretable latent values with no collapsing issues which the baseline models suffer from. Also, we show that the learned latent representation from the DirVAE achieves the best classification accuracy in the semi-supervised and the supervised classification tasks on MNIST, OMNIGLOT, and SVHN compared to the baseline VAEs. Finally, we demonstrated that the DirVAE augmented topic models show better performances in most cases.",

Prior work in inverse reinforcement learning can account for specific, known biases, but cannot handle demonstrators with unknown biases. In this work, we explore the idea of learning the demonstrator's planning algorithm (including their unknown biases), along with their reward function. What makes this challenging is that any demonstration could be explained either by positing a term in the reward function, or by positing a particular systematic bias. We explore what assumptions are sufficient for avoiding this impossibility result: either access to tasks with known rewards which enable estimating the planner separately, or that the demonstrator is sufficiently close to optimal that this can serve as a regularizer. In our exploration with synthetic models of human biases, we find that it is possible to adapt to different biases and perform better than assuming a fixed model of the demonstrator, such as Boltzmann rationality.",

    "title": "Amortized Bayesian Meta-Learning",
    "abstract": "Meta-learning, or learning-to-learn, has proven to be a successful strategy in attacking problems in supervised learning and reinforcement learning that involve small amounts of data. State-of-the-art solutions involve learning an initialization and/or learning algorithm using a set of training episodes so that the meta learner can generalize to an evaluation episode quickly. These methods perform well but often lack good quantification of uncertainty, which can be vital to real-world applications when data is lacking. We propose a meta-learning method which efficiently amortizes hierarchical variational inference across tasks, learning a prior distribution over neural network weights so that a few steps of Bayes by Backprop will produce a good task-specific approximate posterior. We show that our method produces good uncertainty estimates on contextual bandit and few-shot learning benchmarks.",

    "abstract": "The ability to detect when an input sample was not drawn from the training distribution is an important  desirable property of deep neural networks. In this paper, we show that a simple ensembling of first and second order deep feature statistics can be exploited to effectively differentiate in-distribution and out-of-distribution samples. Specifically, we observe that  the mean and standard deviation within feature maps  differs greatly between in-distribution and out-of-distribution samples. Based on this observation, we propose a simple and  efficient plug-and-play detection procedure that does not require re-training, pre-processing or changes to the model.  The proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art by a large margin in all standard benchmarking tasks, while being much simpler to implement and execute. Notably, our method improves the true negative rate from 39.6% to 95.3% when 95% of in-distribution (CIFAR-100) are correctly detected using a DenseNet and the out-of-distribution dataset is TinyImageNet resize. The source code of our method will be made publicly available.",

    "abstract": "We address two challenges of probabilistic topic modelling in order to better estimate\nthe probability of a word in a given context, i.e., P(wordjcontext) : (1) No\nLanguage Structure in Context: Probabilistic topic models ignore word order by\nsummarizing a given context as a “bag-of-word” and consequently the semantics\nof words in the context is lost. In this work, we incorporate language structure\nby combining a neural autoregressive topic model (TM) with a LSTM based language\nmodel (LSTM-LM) in a single probabilistic framework. The LSTM-LM\nlearns a vector-space representation of each word by accounting for word order\nin local collocation patterns, while the TM simultaneously learns a latent representation\nfrom the entire document. In addition, the LSTM-LM models complex\ncharacteristics of language (e.g., syntax and semantics), while the TM discovers\nthe underlying thematic structure in a collection of documents. We unite two complementary\nparadigms of learning the meaning of word occurrences by combining\na topic model and a language model in a unified probabilistic framework, named\nas ctx-DocNADE. (2) Limited Context and/or Smaller training corpus of documents:\nIn settings with a small number of word occurrences (i.e., lack of context)\nin short text or data sparsity in a corpus of few documents, the application of TMs\nis challenging. We address this challenge by incorporating external knowledge\ninto neural autoregressive topic models via a language modelling approach: we\nuse word embeddings as input of a LSTM-LM with the aim to improve the wordtopic\nmapping on a smaller and/or short-text corpus. The proposed DocNADE\nextension is named as ctx-DocNADEe.\n\nWe present novel neural autoregressive topic model variants coupled with neural\nlanguage models and embeddings priors that consistently outperform state-of-theart\ngenerative topic models in terms of generalization (perplexity), interpretability\n(topic coherence) and applicability (retrieval and classification) over 6 long-text\nand 8 short-text datasets from diverse domains.",

    "abstract": "In Variational Auto-Encoder (VAE), the default choice of reconstruction loss function between the decoded sample and the input is the squared $L_2$. We propose to replace it with the log hyperbolic cosine (log-cosh) loss, which behaves as  $L_2$ at small values and as $L_1$ at large values, and differentiable everywhere. Compared with $L_2$, the log-cosh loss improves the reconstruction without damaging the latent space optimization, thus automatically keeping a balance between the reconstruction and the generation. Extensive experiments on MNIST and CelebA datasets show that the log-cosh reconstruction loss significantly improves the performance of VAE and its variants in output quality, measured by sharpness and FID score. In addition, the gradient of the log-cosh is a simple tanh function, which makes the implementation of gradient descent as simple as adding one sentence in coding. ",

    "abstract": "It has been argued that current machine learning models do not have commonsense, and therefore must be hard-coded with prior knowledge (Marcus, 2018). Here we show surprising evidence that language models can already learn to capture certain common sense knowledge. Our key observation is that a language model can compute the probability of any statement, and this probability can be used to evaluate the truthfulness of that statement.  On the Winograd Schema Challenge (Levesque et al., 2011), language models are 11% higher in accuracy than previous state-of-the-art supervised methods. Language models can also be fine-tuned for the task of Mining Commonsense Knowledge on ConceptNet to achieve an F1 score of 0.912 and 0.824, outperforming previous best results (Jastrzebskiet al., 2018).  Further analysis demonstrates that language models can discover unique features of Winograd Schema contexts that decide the correct answers without explicit supervision.",

    "abstract": "RMSProp and ADAM continue to be extremely popular algorithms for training neural nets but their theoretical convergence properties have remained unclear. Further, recent work has seemed to suggest that these algorithms have worse generalization properties when compared to carefully tuned stochastic gradient descent or its momentum variants. In this work, we make progress towards a deeper understanding of ADAM and RMSProp in two ways. First, we provide proofs that these adaptive gradient algorithms are guaranteed to reach criticality for smooth non-convex objectives, and we give bounds on the running time.\n\nNext we design experiments to empirically study the convergence and generalization properties of RMSProp and ADAM against Nesterov's Accelerated Gradient method on a variety of common autoencoder setups and on VGG-9 with CIFAR-10. Through these experiments we demonstrate the interesting sensitivity that ADAM has to its momentum parameter \\beta_1. We show that at very high values of the momentum parameter (\\beta_1 = 0.99) ADAM outperforms a carefully tuned NAG on most of our experiments, in terms of getting lower training and test losses. On the other hand, NAG can sometimes do better when ADAM's \\beta_1 is set to the most commonly used value: \\beta_1 = 0.9, indicating the importance of tuning the hyperparameters of ADAM to get better generalization performance.\n\nWe also report experiments on different autoencoders to demonstrate that NAG has better abilities in terms of reducing the gradient norms, and it also produces iterates which exhibit an increasing trend for the minimum eigenvalue of the Hessian of the loss function at the iterates.

    "title": "DELTA: DEEP LEARNING TRANSFER USING FEATURE MAP WITH ATTENTION FOR CONVOLUTIONAL NETWORKS",
    "abstract": "Transfer learning through fine-tuning a pre-trained neural network with an extremely large dataset, such as ImageNet, can significantly accelerate training while the accuracy is frequently bottlenecked by the limited dataset size of the new target task. To solve the problem, some regularization methods, constraining the outer layer weights of the target network using the starting point as references (SPAR), have been studied. In this paper, we propose a novel regularized transfer learning framework DELTA, namely DEep Learning Transfer using Feature Map with Attention. Instead of constraining the weights of neural network, DELTA aims to preserve the outer layer outputs of the target network. Specifically, in addition to minimizing the empirical loss, DELTA intends to align the outer layer outputs of two networks, through constraining a subset of feature maps that are precisely selected by attention that has been learned in an supervised learning manner. We evaluate DELTA with the state-of-the-art algorithms, including L2 and L2-SP. The experiment results show that our proposed method outperforms these baselines with higher accuracy for new tasks.",

    "title": "Learning to Refer to 3D Objects with Natural Language",
    "abstract": "Human world knowledge is both structured and flexible. When people see an object, they represent it not as a pixel array but as a meaningful arrangement of semantic parts. Moreover, when people refer to an object, they provide descriptions that are not merely true but also relevant in the current context. Here, we combine these two observations in order to learn fine-grained correspondences between language and contextually relevant geometric properties of 3D objects. To do this, we employed an interactive communication task with human participants to construct a large dataset containing natural utterances referring to 3D objects from ShapeNet in a wide variety of contexts. Using this dataset, we developed neural listener and speaker models with strong capacity for generalization. By performing targeted lesions of visual and linguistic input, we discovered that the neural listener depends heavily on part-related words and associates these words correctly with the corresponding geometric properties of objects, suggesting that it has learned task-relevant structure linking the two input modalities. We further show that a neural speaker that is `listener-aware' --- that plans its utterances according to how an imagined listener would interpret its words in context --- produces more discriminative referring expressions than an `listener-unaware' speaker, as measured by human performance in identifying the correct object.",

    "title": "Graph HyperNetworks for Neural Architecture Search",
    "abstract": "Neural architecture search (NAS) automatically finds the best task-specific neural network topology, outperforming many manual architecture designs. However, it can be prohibitively expensive as the search requires training thousands of different networks, while each training run can last for hours. In this work, we propose the Graph HyperNetwork (GHN) to amortize the search cost: given an architecture, it directly generates the weights by running inference on a graph neural network. GHNs model the topology of an architecture and therefore can predict network performance more accurately than regular hypernetworks and premature early stopping. To perform NAS, we randomly sample architectures and use the validation accuracy of networks with GHN generated weights as the surrogate search signal. GHNs are fast - they can search nearly 10× faster than other random search methods on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet. GHNs can be further extended to the anytime prediction setting, where they have found networks with better speed-accuracy tradeoff than the state-of-the-art manual designs.",

    "abstract": "Answerer in Questioner's Mind (AQM) is an information-theoretic framework that has been recently proposed for task-oriented dialog systems. AQM benefits from asking a question that would maximize the information gain when it is asked. However, due to its intrinsic nature of explicitly calculating the information gain, AQM has a limitation when the solution space is very large. To address this, we propose AQM+ that can deal with a large-scale problem and ask a question that is more coherent to the current context of the dialog. We evaluate our method on GuessWhich, a challenging task-oriented visual dialog problem, where the number of candidate classes is near 10K. Our experimental results and ablation studies show that AQM+ outperforms the state-of-the-art models by a remarkable margin with a reasonable approximation. In particular, the proposed AQM+ reduces more than 60% of error as the dialog proceeds, while the comparative algorithms diminish the error by less than 6%. Based on our results, we argue that AQM+ is a general task-oriented dialog algorithm that can be applied for non-yes-or-no responses. ",

    "abstract": "Learning explainable patient temporal embeddings from observational data has mostly ignored the use of RNN architecture that excel in capturing temporal data dependencies but at the expense of explainability. This paper addresses this problem by introducing and applying an information theoretic approach to estimate the degree of explainability of such architectures. Using a communication paradigm, we formalize metrics of explainability by estimating the amount of information that an AI model needs to convey to a human end user to explain and rationalize its outputs. A key aspect of this work is to model human prior knowledge at the receiving end and measure the lack of explainability as a deviation from human prior knowledge. We apply this paradigm to medical concept representation problems by regularizing loss functions of temporal autoencoders according to the derived explainability metrics to guide the learning process towards models producing explainable outputs. We illustrate the approach with convincing experimental results for the generation of explainable temporal embeddings for critical care patient data.",

    "abstract": "Presently the most successful approaches to semi-supervised learning are based on consistency regularization, whereby a model is trained to be robust to small perturbations of its inputs and parameters. To understand consistency regularization, we conceptually explore how loss geometry interacts with training procedures. The consistency loss dramatically improves generalization performance over supervised-only training; however, we show that SGD struggles to converge on the consistency loss and continues to make large steps that lead to changes in predictions on the test data. Motivated by these observations, we propose to train consistency-based methods with Stochastic Weight Averaging (SWA), a recent approach which averages weights along the trajectory of SGD with a modified learning rate schedule. We also propose fast-SWA, which further accelerates convergence by averaging multiple points within each cycle of a cyclical learning rate schedule. With weight averaging, we achieve the best known semi-supervised results on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100, over many different quantities of labeled training data. For example, we achieve 5.0% error on CIFAR-10 with only 4000 labels, compared to the previous best result in the literature of 6.3%.",

    "abstract": "For autonomous agents to successfully operate in the real world, the ability to anticipate future scene states is a key competence. In real-world scenarios, future states become increasingly uncertain and multi-modal, particularly on long time horizons. Dropout based Bayesian inference provides a computationally tractable, theoretically well grounded approach to learn different hypotheses/models to deal with uncertain futures and make predictions that correspond well to observations -- are well calibrated. However, it turns out that such approaches fall short to capture complex real-world scenes, even falling behind in accuracy when compared to the plain deterministic approaches. This is because the used log-likelihood estimate discourages diversity. In this work, we propose a novel Bayesian formulation for anticipating future scene states which leverages synthetic likelihoods that encourage the learning of diverse models to accurately capture the multi-modal nature of future scene states. We show that our approach achieves accurate state-of-the-art predictions and calibrated probabilities through extensive experiments for scene anticipation on Cityscapes dataset. Moreover, we show that our approach generalizes across diverse tasks such as digit generation and precipitation forecasting.",

Then, assuming that the principal components are sparse, we show that taking f in such a way that f'(0) = f''(0) = 0 allows for powerful recovery of the principal components, thereby generalizing previous ideas involving more specific f functions such as the soft-thresholding function.",

    "abstract": "Spoken language understanding (SLU) is a critical component in building dialogue systems. When building models for novel natural language domains, a major challenge is the lack of data in the new domains, no matter whether the data is annotated or not. Recognizing and annotating ``intent'' and ``slot'' of natural languages is a time-consuming process. Therefore, spoken language understanding in low resource domains remains a crucial problem to address. In this paper, we address this problem by proposing a transfer-learning method, whereby a SLU model is transferred to a novel but data-poor domain via a deep neural network framework. We also introduce meta-learning in our work to bridge the semantic relations between seen and unseen data, allowing new intents to be recognized and new slots to be filled with much lower new training effort. We show the performance improvement with extensive experimental results for spoken language understanding in low resource domains. We show that our method can also handle novel intent recognition and slot-filling tasks. Our methodology provides a feasible solution for alleviating data shortages in spoken language understanding.",

    "abstract": "Reinforcement learning (RL) agents optimize only the features specified in a reward function and are indifferent to anything left out inadvertently. This means that we must not only specify what to do, but also the much larger space of what not to do. It is easy to forget these preferences, since these preferences are already satisfied in our environment. This motivates our key insight: when a robot is deployed in an environment that humans act in, the state of the environment is already optimized for what humans want. We can therefore use this implicit preference information from the state to fill in the blanks. We develop an algorithm based on Maximum Causal Entropy IRL and use it to evaluate the idea in a suite of proof-of-concept environments designed to show its properties. We find that information from the initial state can be used to infer both side effects that should be avoided as well as preferences for how the environment should be organized.

    "abstract": "The correct interpretation of quantifier statements in the context of a visual scene requires non-trivial inference mechanisms. For the example of \"most\", we discuss two strategies which rely on fundamentally different cognitive concepts. Our aim is to identify what strategy deep learning models for visual question answering learn when trained on such questions. To this end, we carefully design data to replicate experiments from psycholinguistics where the same question was investigated for humans. Focusing on the FiLM visual question answering model, our experiments indicate that a form of approximate number system emerges whose performance declines with more difficult scenes as predicted by Weber's law. Moreover, we identify confounding factors, like spatial arrangement of the scene, which impede the effectiveness of this system.",

    "abstract": "Recently, Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have emerged as a popular alternative for modeling complex high dimensional distributions. Most of the existing works implicitly assume that the clean samples from the target distribution are easily available. However, in many applications, this assumption is violated. In this paper, we consider the problem of learning GANs under the observation setting when the samples from target distribution are given by the superposition of two structured components. We propose two novel frameworks: denoising-GAN and demixing-GAN. The denoising-GAN assumes access to clean samples from the second component and try to learn the other distribution, whereas demixing-GAN learns the distribution of the components at the same time. Through comprehensive numerical experiments, we demonstrate that proposed frameworks can generate clean samples from unknown distributions, and provide competitive performance in tasks such as denoising, demixing, and compressive sensing.",

    "abstract": "In this article we use rate-distortion theory, a branch of information theory devoted to the problem of lossy compression, to shed light on an important problem in latent variable modeling of data: is there room to improve the model? One way to address this question is to find an upper bound on the probability (equivalently a lower bound on the negative log likelihood) that the model can assign to some data as one varies the prior and/or the likelihood function in a latent variable model. The core of our contribution is to formally show that the problem of optimizing priors in latent variable models is exactly an instance of the variational optimization problem that information theorists solve when computing rate-distortion functions, and then to use this to derive a lower bound on negative log likelihood. Moreover, we will show that if changing the prior can improve the log likelihood, then there is a way to change the likelihood function instead and attain the same log likelihood, and thus rate-distortion theory is of relevance to both optimizing priors as well as optimizing likelihood functions. We will experimentally argue for the usefulness of quantities derived from rate-distortion theory in latent variable modeling by applying them to a problem in image modeling.",

We prove that even for one-hidden-layer networks with \"slightest\" nonlinearity, the empirical risks have spurious local minima in most cases. Our results thus indicate that in general \"no spurious local minim\" is a property limited to deep linear networks, and insights obtained from linear networks may not be robust. Specifically, for ReLU(-like) networks we constructively prove that for almost all practical datasets there exist infinitely many local minima. We also present a counterexample for more general activations (sigmoid, tanh, arctan, ReLU, etc.), for which there exists a bad local minimum. Our results make the least restrictive assumptions relative to existing results on spurious local optima in neural networks. We complete our discussion by presenting a comprehensive characterization of global optimality for deep linear networks, which unifies other results on this topic.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we extend the persona-based sequence-to-sequence (Seq2Seq) neural network conversation model to a multi-turn dialogue scenario by modifying the state-of-the-art hredGAN architecture to simultaneously capture utterance attributes such as speaker identity, dialogue topic, speaker sentiments and so on. The proposed system, phredGAN has a persona-based HRED generator (PHRED) and a conditional discriminator. We also explore two approaches to accomplish the conditional discriminator: (1) $phredGAN_a$, a system that passes the attribute representation as an additional input into a traditional adversarial discriminator, and (2) $phredGAN_d$, a dual discriminator system which in addition to the adversarial discriminator, collaboratively predicts the attribute(s) that generated the input utterance. To demonstrate the superior performance of phredGAN over the persona SeqSeq model, we experiment with two conversational datasets, the Ubuntu Dialogue Corpus (UDC) and TV series transcripts from the Big Bang Theory and Friends. Performance comparison is made with respect to a variety of quantitative measures as well as crowd-sourced human evaluation. We also explore the trade-offs from using either variant of $phredGAN$ on datasets with many but weak attribute modalities (such as with Big Bang Theory and Friends) and ones with few but strong attribute modalities (customer-agent interactions in Ubuntu dataset).",

    "title": "Training Hard-Threshold Networks with Combinatorial Search in a Discrete Target Propagation Setting",
    "abstract": "Learning deep neural networks with hard-threshold activation has recently become an important problem due to the proliferation of resource-constrained computing devices. In order to circumvent the inability to train with backpropagation in the present of hard-threshold activations, \\cite{friesen2017} introduced a discrete target propagation framework for training hard-threshold networks in a layer-by-layer fashion. Rather than using a gradient-based target heuristic, we explore the use of search methods for solving the target setting problem. Building on both traditional combinatorial optimization algorithms and gradient-based techniques, we develop a novel search algorithm Guided Random Local Search (GRLS). We demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm in training small networks on several datasets and evaluate our target-setting algorithm compared to simpler search methods and gradient-based techniques. Our results indicate that combinatorial optimization is a viable method for training hard-threshold networks that may have the potential to eventually surpass gradient-based methods in many settings.

    "abstract": "We present a deep generative model, named Monge-Amp\\`ere flow, which builds on continuous-time gradient flow arising from the Monge-Amp\\`ere equation in optimal transport theory. The generative map from the latent space to the data space follows a dynamical system, where a learnable potential function guides a compressible fluid to flow towards the target density distribution. Training of the model amounts to solving an optimal control problem. The Monge-Amp\\`ere flow has tractable likelihoods and supports efficient sampling and inference. One can easily impose symmetry constraints in the generative model by designing suitable scalar potential functions. We apply the approach to unsupervised density estimation of the MNIST dataset and variational calculation of the two-dimensional Ising model at the critical point. This approach brings insights and techniques from Monge-Amp\\`ere equation, optimal transport, and fluid dynamics into reversible flow-based generative models. ",

    "abstract": "Although stochastic gradient descent (SGD) is a driving force behind the recent success of deep learning, our understanding of its dynamics in a high-dimensional parameter space is limited. In recent years, some researchers have used the stochasticity of minibatch gradients, or the signal-to-noise ratio, to better characterize the learning dynamics of SGD. Inspired from these work, we here analyze SGD from a geometrical perspective by inspecting the stochasticity of the norms and directions of minibatch gradients. We propose a model of the directional concentration for minibatch gradients through von Mises-Fisher (VMF) distribution, and show that the directional uniformity of minibatch gradients increases over the course of SGD. We empirically verify our result using deep convolutional networks and observe a higher correlation between the gradient stochasticity and the proposed directional uniformity than that against the gradient norm stochasticity, suggesting that the directional statistics of minibatch gradients is a major factor behind SGD.",

    "abstract": "The ground-breaking performance obtained by deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for image processing tasks is inspiring research efforts attempting to extend it for 3D geometric tasks. One of the main challenge in applying CNNs to 3D shape analysis is how to define a natural convolution operator on non-euclidean surfaces. In this paper, we present a method for applying deep learning to 3D surfaces using their spherical descriptors and alt-az anisotropic convolution on 2-sphere. A cascade set of geodesic disk filters rotate on the 2-sphere and collect spherical patterns and so to extract geometric features for various 3D shape analysis tasks. We demonstrate theoretically and experimentally that our proposed method has the possibility to bridge the gap between 2D images and 3D shapes with the desired rotation equivariance/invariance, and its effectiveness is evaluated in applications of non-rigid/ rigid shape classification and shape retrieval.",

    "abstract": "We study discrete time dynamical systems governed by the state equation $h_{t+1}=ϕ(Ah_t+Bu_t)$. Here A,B are weight matrices, ϕ is an activation function, and $u_t$ is the input data. This relation is the backbone of recurrent neural networks (e.g. LSTMs) which have broad applications in sequential learning tasks. We utilize stochastic gradient descent to learn the weight matrices from a finite input/state trajectory $(u_t,h_t)_{t=0}^N$. We prove that SGD estimate linearly converges to the ground truth weights while using near-optimal sample size. Our results apply to increasing activations whose derivatives are bounded away from zero. The analysis is based on i) an SGD convergence result with nonlinear activations and ii) careful statistical characterization of the state vector. Numerical experiments verify the fast convergence of SGD on ReLU and leaky ReLU in consistence with our theory.",

    "title": "ATTACK GRAPH CONVOLUTIONAL NETWORKS BY ADDING FAKE NODES",
    "abstract": "Graph convolutional networks (GCNs) have been widely used for classifying graph nodes in the semi-supervised setting.\nPrevious works have shown that GCNs are vulnerable to the perturbation on adjacency and feature matrices of existing nodes. However, it is unrealistic to change the connections of  existing nodes in many applications, such as existing users in social networks. In this paper, we investigate methods attacking GCNs by adding fake nodes. A greedy algorithm is proposed to generate adjacency and feature matrices of fake nodes, aiming to minimize the classification accuracy on the existing ones. In additional, we introduce a discriminator to classify fake nodes from real nodes, and propose a Greedy-GAN algorithm to simultaneously update the discriminator and the attacker, to make fake nodes indistinguishable to the real ones.  Our non-targeted attack decreases the accuracy of GCN down to 0.10, and our targeted attack reaches a success rate of 0.99 for attacking the whole datasets, and 0.94 on average for attacking a single node.",

    "title": "Caveats for information bottleneck in deterministic scenarios",
    "abstract": "Information bottleneck (IB) is a method for extracting information from one random variable X that is relevant for predicting another random variable Y. To do so, IB identifies an intermediate \"bottleneck\" variable T that has low mutual information I(X;T) and high mutual information I(Y;T). The \"IB curve\" characterizes the set of bottleneck variables that achieve maximal I(Y;T) for a given I(X;T), and is typically explored by maximizing the \"IB Lagrangian\", I(Y;T) - βI(X;T). In some cases, Y is a deterministic function of X, including many classification problems in supervised learning where the output class Y is a deterministic function of the input X. We demonstrate three caveats when using IB in any situation where Y is a deterministic function of X: (1) the IB curve cannot be recovered by maximizing the IB Lagrangian for different values of β; (2) there are \"uninteresting\" trivial solutions at all points of the IB curve; and (3) for multi-layer classifiers that achieve low prediction error, different layers cannot exhibit a strict trade-off between compression and prediction, contrary to a recent proposal. We also show that when Y is a small perturbation away from being a deterministic function of X, these three caveats arise in an approximate way. To address problem (1), we propose a functional that, unlike the IB Lagrangian, can recover the IB curve in all cases. We demonstrate the three caveats on the MNIST dataset.",

    "abstract": "We present a new family of objective functions, which we term the Conditional Entropy Bottleneck (CEB). These objectives are motivated by the Minimum Necessary Information (MNI) criterion. We demonstrate the application of CEB to classification tasks. We show that CEB gives: well-calibrated predictions; strong detection of challenging out-of-distribution examples and powerful whitebox adversarial examples; and substantial robustness to those adversaries. Finally, we report that CEB fails to learn from information-free datasets, providing a possible resolution to the problem of generalization observed in Zhang et al. (2016).",

Our algorithm works for a general class of (potentially overlapping) patches, including commonly used structures for computer vision tasks. Our algorithm draws ideas from (1) isotonic regression for learning neural networks and (2) landscape analysis of non-convex matrix factorization problems. We believe these findings may inspire further development in designing provable algorithms for learning neural networks and other complex models. While our focus is theoretical, we also present experiments that illustrate our theoretical findings.",

In the proposed framework an agent consists of multiple specialized sub-agents and a meta-agent that learns to aggregate the answers from sub-agents to produce a final answer. Sub-agents are trained on disjoint partitions of the training data, while the meta-agent is trained on the full training set. Our method makes learning faster, because it is highly parallelizable, and has better generalization performance than strong baselines, such as an ensemble of agents trained on the full data. We show that the improved performance is due to the increased diversity of reformulation strategies. ",

    "title": "Optimal Completion Distillation for Sequence Learning",
    "abstract": "We present Optimal Completion Distillation (OCD), a training procedure for optimizing sequence to sequence models based on edit distance. OCD is efficient, has no hyper-parameters of its own, and does not require pre-training or joint optimization with conditional log-likelihood. Given a partial sequence generated by the model, we first identify the set of optimal suffixes that minimize the total edit distance, using an efficient dynamic programming algorithm.  Then, for each position of the generated sequence, we use a target distribution which puts equal probability on the first token of all the optimal suffixes. OCD achieves the state-of-the-art performance on end-to-end speech recognition, on both Wall Street Journal and Librispeech datasets, achieving $9.3\\%$ WER and $4.5\\%$ WER, respectively.",

    "abstract": "Interactions such as double negation in sentences and scene interactions in images are common forms of complex dependencies captured by state-of-the-art machine learning models. We propose Mahé, a novel approach to provide Model-Agnostic Hierarchical Explanations of how powerful machine learning models, such as deep neural networks, capture these interactions as either dependent on or free of the context of data instances. Specifically, Mahé provides context-dependent explanations by a novel local interpretation algorithm that effectively captures any-order interactions, and obtains context-free explanations through generalizing context-dependent interactions to explain global behaviors. Experimental results show that Mahé obtains improved local interaction interpretations over state-of-the-art methods and successfully provides explanations of interactions that are context-free.",

    "abstract": "Extractive summarization methods operate by ranking and selecting the sentences which best encapsulate the theme of a given document. They do not fare well in domains like fictional narratives where there is no central theme and core information is not encapsulated by a small set of sentences. For the purpose of reducing the size of the document while conveying the idea expressed by each sentence, we need more sentence specific methods. Telegraphic summarization, which selects short segments across several sentences, is better suited for such domains. Telegraphic summarization captures the plot better by retaining shorter versions of each sentence while not really concerning itself with grammatically linking these segments. In this paper, we propose an unsupervised deep learning network (NUTS) to generate telegraphic summaries.\nWe use multiple encoder-decoder networks and learn to drop portions of the text that are inferable from the chosen segments. The model is agnostic to both sentence length and style. We demonstrate that the summaries produced by our model show significant quantitative and qualitative improvement over those produced by existing methods and baselines.",

    "abstract": "Generative adversarial networks (GANs) are a class of deep generative models which aim to learn a target distribution in an unsupervised fashion. While they were successfully applied to many problems, training a GAN is a notoriously challenging task and requires a significant amount of hyperparameter tuning, neural architecture engineering, and a non-trivial amount of ``tricks\". The success in many practical applications coupled with the lack of a measure to quantify the failure modes of GANs resulted in a plethora of proposed losses, regularization and normalization schemes, and neural architectures. In this work we take a sober view of the current state of GANs from a practical perspective. We reproduce the current state of the art and go beyond fairly exploring the GAN landscape. We discuss common pitfalls and reproducibility issues, open-source our code on Github, and provide pre-trained models on TensorFlow Hub.",

    "title": "Security Analysis of Deep Neural Networks Operating in the Presence of Cache Side-Channel Attacks",
    "abstract": "Recent work has introduced attacks that extract the architecture information of deep neural networks (DNN), as this knowledge enhances an adversary’s capability to conduct attacks on black-box networks. This paper presents the first in-depth security analysis of DNN fingerprinting attacks that exploit cache side-channels.  First, we define the threat model for these attacks:  our adversary does not need the ability to query the victim model; instead, she runs a co-located process on the host machine victim ’s deep learning  (DL) system is running and passively monitors the accesses of the target functions in the shared framework.  Second, we introduce DeepRecon, an attack that reconstructs the architecture of the victim network by using the internal information extracted via Flush+Reload, a cache side-channel technique. Once the attacker observes function invocations that map directly to architecture attributes of the victim network, the attacker can reconstruct the victim’s entire network architecture.  In our evaluation, we demonstrate that an attacker can accurately reconstruct two complex networks (VGG19 and ResNet50) having only observed one forward propagation. Based on the extracted architecture attributes, we also demonstrate that an attacker can build a meta-model that accurately fingerprints the architecture and family of the pre-trained model in a transfer learning setting. From this meta-model,  we evaluate the importance of the observed attributes in the fingerprinting process. Third, we propose and evaluate new framework-level defense techniques that obfuscate our attacker’s observations. Our empirical security analysis represents a step toward understanding the DNNs’ vulnerability to cache side-channel attacks.",

    "abstract": "We present a new algorithm to train a robust neural network against adversarial attacks. \nOur algorithm is motivated by the following two ideas. First, although recent work has demonstrated that fusing randomness can improve the robustness of neural networks (Liu 2017), we noticed that adding noise blindly to all the layers is not the optimal way to incorporate randomness. \nInstead, we model randomness under the framework of Bayesian Neural Network (BNN) to formally learn the posterior distribution of models in a scalable way. Second, we formulate the mini-max problem in BNN to learn the best model distribution under adversarial attacks, leading to an adversarial-trained Bayesian neural net. Experiment results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm achieves state-of-the-art performance under strong attacks. On CIFAR-10 with VGG network, our model leads to 14% accuracy improvement compared with adversarial training (Madry 2017) and random self-ensemble (Liu, 2017) under PGD attack with 0.035 distortion, and the gap becomes even larger on a subset of ImageNet.",

    "abstract": "Recently, deep neural networks have achieved superhuman performance in various games such as Go, chess and Shogi. Compared to Go, China Competitive Poker, also known as Dou dizhu, is a type of imperfect information game, including hidden information, randomness, multi-agent cooperation and competition. It has become widespread and is now a national game in China. We introduce an approach to play China Competitive Poker using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to predict actions. This network is trained by supervised learning from human game records. Without any search, the network already beats the best AI program by a large margin, and also beats the best human amateur players in duplicate mode.",

    "title": "Learning from Positive and Unlabeled Data with a Selection Bias",
    "abstract": "We consider the problem of learning a binary classifier only from positive data and unlabeled data (PU learning). Recent methods of PU learning commonly assume that the labeled positive data are identically distributed as the unlabeled positive data. However, this assumption is unrealistic in many instances of PU learning because it fails to capture the existence of a selection bias in the labeling process. When the data has a selection bias, it is difficult to learn the Bayes optimal classifier by conventional methods of PU learning. In this paper, we propose a method to partially identify the classifier. The proposed algorithm learns a scoring function that preserves the order induced by the class posterior under mild assumptions, which can be used as a classifier by setting an appropriate threshold. Through experiments, we show that the method outperforms previous methods for PU learning on various real-world datasets.",

    "title": "Meta-Learning for Contextual Bandit Exploration",
    "abstract": "We describe MÊLÉE, a meta-learning algorithm for learning a good exploration policy in the interactive contextual bandit setting. Here, an algorithm must take actions based on contexts, and learn based only on a reward signal from the action taken, thereby generating an exploration/exploitation trade-off. MÊLÉE addresses this trade-off by learning a good exploration strategy based on offline synthetic tasks, on which it can simulate the contextual bandit setting. Based on these simulations, MÊLÉE uses an imitation learning strategy to learn a good exploration policy that can then be applied to true contextual bandit tasks at test time. We compare MÊLÉE to seven strong baseline contextual bandit algorithms on a set of three hundred real-world datasets, on which it outperforms alternatives in most settings, especially when differences in rewards are large. Finally, we demonstrate the importance of having a rich feature representation for learning how to explore.\n",

Likelihood-based training  of  these  models  requires  restricting  their  architectures  to  allow  cheap computation of Jacobian determinants.  Alternatively, the Jacobian trace can be used if the transformation is specified by an ordinary differential equation. In this paper, we use Hutchinson’s trace estimator to give a scalable unbiased estimate of the log-density.  The result is a continuous-time invertible generative model with unbiased density estimation and one-pass sampling, while allowing unrestricted neural network architectures. We demonstrate our approach on high-dimensional density  estimation,  image  generation,  and  variational  inference,  achieving  the state-of-the-art among exact likelihood methods with efficient sampling.",

Binarization of operations in convolutional neural networks has shown promising results in reducing the model size and computing efficiency. \nIn this paper, we tackle the character recognition problem using a strategy different from the existing literature by proposing local binary pattern networks or LBPNet that can learn and perform bit-wise operations in an end-to-end fashion. LBPNet uses local binary comparisons and random projection in place of conventional convolution (or approximation of convolution) operations, providing important means to improve memory and speed efficiency that is particularly suited for small footprint devices and hardware accelerators. These operations can be implemented efficiently on different platforms including direct hardware implementation. LBPNet demonstrates its particular advantage on the character classification task where the content is composed of strokes. We applied LBPNet to benchmark datasets like MNIST, SVHN, DHCD, ICDAR, and Chars74K and observed encouraging results.",

We propose a novel approach, Adversarial Inference by Matching priors and conditionals (AIM), which explicitly matches prior and conditional distributions in both data and code spaces, and puts a direct constraint on the dependency structure of the generative model. We derive an equivalent form of the prior and conditional matching objective that can be optimized efficiently without any parametric assumption on the data. We validate the effectiveness of AIM on the MNIST, CIFAR-10, and CelebA datasets by conducting quantitative and qualitative evaluations. Results demonstrate that AIM significantly improves both reconstruction and generation as compared to other adversarial inference models.",

We instantiate this relational view of semantics in a series of neural models based on variants of relation networks (RNs) which represent a set of objects (for us, words forming a sentence) in terms of representations of pairs of objects. We propose two extensions to the basic RN model for natural language. First, building on the intuition that not all word pairs are equally informative about the meaning of a sentence, we use constraints based on both supervised and unsupervised dependency syntax to control which relations influence the representation. Second, since higher-order relations are poorly captured by a sum of pairwise relations, we use a recurrent extension of RNs to propagate information so as to form representations of higher order relations. Experiments on sentence classification, sentence pair classification, and machine translation reveal that, while basic RNs are only modestly effective for sentence representation, recurrent RNs with latent syntax are a reliably powerful representational device.",

    "title": "Nested Dithered Quantization for Communication Reduction in Distributed Training",
    "abstract": "In distributed training, the communication cost due to the transmission of gradients\nor the parameters of the deep model is a major bottleneck in scaling up the number\nof processing nodes. To address this issue, we propose dithered quantization for\nthe transmission of the stochastic gradients and show that training with Dithered\nQuantized Stochastic Gradients (DQSG) is similar to the training with unquantized\nSGs perturbed by an independent bounded uniform noise, in contrast to the other\nquantization methods where the perturbation depends on the gradients and hence,\ncomplicating the convergence analysis. We study the convergence of training\nalgorithms using DQSG and the trade off between the number of quantization\nlevels and the training time. Next, we observe that there is a correlation among the\nSGs computed by workers that can be utilized to further reduce the communication\noverhead without any performance loss. Hence, we develop a simple yet effective\nquantization scheme, nested dithered quantized SG (NDQSG), that can reduce the\ncommunication significantly without requiring the workers communicating extra\ninformation to each other. We prove that although NDQSG requires significantly\nless bits, it can achieve the same quantization variance bound as DQSG. Our\nsimulation results confirm the effectiveness of training using DQSG and NDQSG\nin reducing the communication bits or the convergence time compared to the\nexisting methods without sacrificing the accuracy of the trained model.",

We extend this line of work by imposing hyperbolic geometry on the embeddings used to compute the ubiquitous attention mechanisms for different neural networks architectures. By only changing the geometry of embedding of object representations, we can use the embedding space more efficiently without increasing the number of parameters of the model. Mainly as the number of objects grows exponentially for any semantic distance from the query, hyperbolic geometry  --as opposed to Euclidean geometry-- can encode those objects without having any interference. Our method shows improvements in generalization on neural machine translation on WMT'14 (English to German), learning on graphs (both on synthetic and real-world graph tasks) and visual question answering (CLEVR) tasks while keeping the neural representations compact.",

This allows the  DNN to abstain on confusing or difficult-to-learn examples while improving performance on the non-abstained samples. We show that such deep abstaining classifiers can: (i) learn representations for structured noise -- where noisy training labels or confusing examples are correlated with underlying features -- and then learn to abstain based on such features; (ii) enable robust learning in the presence of arbitrary or unstructured noise by identifying noisy samples; and (iii) be used as an effective out-of-category detector that learns to reliably abstain when presented with samples from  unknown classes. We provide analytical results on loss function behavior that enable automatic tuning of accuracy and coverage, and demonstrate the utility of the deep abstaining classifier using multiple image benchmarks, Results indicate significant improvement in learning in the presence of label noise.",

    "title": "Rethinking the Value of Network Pruning",
    "abstract": "Network pruning is widely used for reducing the heavy inference cost of deep models in low-resource settings. A typical pruning algorithm is a three-stage pipeline, i.e., training (a large model), pruning and fine-tuning. During pruning, according to a certain criterion, redundant weights are pruned and important weights are kept to best preserve the accuracy. In this work, we make several surprising observations which contradict common beliefs. For all state-of-the-art structured pruning algorithms we examined, fine-tuning a pruned model only gives comparable or worse performance than training that model with randomly initialized weights. For pruning algorithms which assume a predefined target network architecture, one can get rid of the full pipeline and directly train the target network from scratch. Our observations are consistent for multiple network architectures, datasets, and tasks, which imply that: 1) training a large, over-parameterized model is often not necessary to obtain an efficient final model, 2) learned ``important'' weights of the large model are typically not useful for the small pruned model, 3) the pruned architecture itself, rather than a set of inherited ``important'' weights, is more crucial to the efficiency in the final model, which suggests that in some cases pruning can be useful as an architecture search paradigm. Our results suggest the need for more careful baseline evaluations in future research on structured pruning methods.  We also compare with the \"Lottery Ticket Hypothesis\" (Frankle & Carbin 2019), and find that with optimal learning rate, the \"winning ticket\" initialization as used in Frankle & Carbin (2019) does not bring improvement over random initialization.",

    "title": "Query-Efficient Hard-label Black-box Attack: An Optimization-based Approach",
    "abstract": "We study the problem of attacking machine learning models in the hard-label black-box setting, where no model information is revealed except that the attacker can make queries to probe the corresponding hard-label decisions. This is a very challenging problem since the direct extension of state-of-the-art white-box attacks (e.g., C&W or PGD) to the hard-label black-box setting will require minimizing a non-continuous step function, which is combinatorial and cannot be solved by a gradient-based optimizer. The only two current approaches are based on random walk on the boundary (Brendel et al., 2017) and random trials to evaluate the loss function (Ilyas et al., 2018), which require lots of queries and lacks convergence guarantees. \nWe propose a novel way to formulate the hard-label black-box attack as a real-valued optimization problem which is usually continuous and can be solved by any zeroth order optimization algorithm. For example, using the Randomized Gradient-Free method (Nesterov & Spokoiny, 2017), we are able to bound the number of iterations needed for our algorithm to achieve stationary points under mild assumptions. We demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms the previous stochastic approaches to attacking convolutional neural networks on MNIST, CIFAR, and ImageNet datasets. More interestingly, we show that the proposed algorithm can also be used to attack other discrete and non-continuous machine learning models, such as Gradient Boosting Decision Trees (GBDT).",

    "abstract": "We propose a simple yet highly effective method that addresses the mode-collapse problem in the Conditional Generative  Adversarial  Network (cGAN). Although conditional distributions are multi-modal (i.e., having many modes) in practice, most cGAN approaches tend to learn an overly simplified distribution where an input is always mapped to a single output regardless of variations in latent code. To address such issue, we propose to explicitly regularize the generator to produce diverse outputs depending on latent codes. The proposed regularization is simple, general, and can be easily integrated into most conditional GAN objectives. Additionally, explicit regularization on generator allows our method to control a balance between visual quality and diversity. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on three conditional generation tasks: image-to-image translation, image inpainting, and future video prediction. We show that simple addition of our regularization to existing models leads to surprisingly diverse generations, substantially outperforming the previous approaches for multi-modal conditional generation specifically designed in each individual task.",

    "abstract": "With the increasing demand to deploy convolutional neural networks (CNNs) on mobile platforms, the sparse kernel approach was proposed, which could save more parameters than the standard convolution while maintaining accuracy. However, despite the great potential, no prior research has pointed out how to craft an sparse kernel design with such potential (i.e., effective design), and all prior works just adopt simple combinations of existing sparse kernels such as group convolution. Meanwhile due to the large design space it is also impossible to try all combinations of existing sparse kernels. In this paper, we are the first in the field to consider how to craft an effective sparse kernel design by eliminating the large design space. Specifically, we present a sparse kernel scheme to illustrate how to reduce the space from three aspects. First, in terms of composition we remove designs composed of repeated layers. Second, to remove designs with large accuracy degradation, we find an unified property named~\\emph{information field} behind various sparse kernel designs, which could directly indicate the final accuracy. Last, we remove designs in two cases where a better parameter efficiency could be achieved. Additionally, we provide detailed efficiency analysis on the final 4 designs in our scheme. Experimental results validate the idea of our scheme by showing that our scheme is able to find designs which are more efficient in using parameters and computation with similar or higher accuracy.",

Though there have been a few sound extensions to nonlinear function approximation, such as nonlinear gradient temporal difference learning, these methods have largely not been adopted, eschewed in favour of simpler but not sound methods like temporal difference learning and Q-learning. In this work, we provide a two-timescale network (TTN) architecture that enables linear methods to be used to learn values, with a nonlinear representation learned at a slower timescale. The approach facilitates the use of algorithms developed for the linear setting, such as data-efficient least-squares methods, eligibility traces and the myriad of recently developed linear policy evaluation algorithms, to provide nonlinear value estimates. We prove convergence for TTNs, with particular care given to ensure convergence of the fast linear component under potentially dependent features provided by the learned representation. We empirically demonstrate the benefits of TTNs, compared to other nonlinear value function approximation algorithms, both for policy evaluation and control.    ",

    "abstract": "We study many-class few-shot (MCFS) problem in both supervised learning and meta-learning scenarios. Compared to the well-studied many-class many-shot and few-class few-shot problems, MCFS problem commonly occurs in practical applications but is rarely studied. MCFS brings new challenges because it needs to distinguish between many classes, but only a few samples per class are available for training. In this paper, we propose ``memory-augmented hierarchical-classification network (MahiNet)'' for MCFS learning. It addresses the ``many-class'' problem by exploring the class hierarchy, e.g., the coarse-class label that covers a subset of fine classes, which helps to narrow down the candidates for the fine class and is cheaper to obtain. MahiNet uses a convolutional neural network (CNN) to extract features, and integrates a memory-augmented attention module with a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) to produce the probabilities over coarse and fine classes. While the MLP extends the linear classifier, the attention module extends a KNN classifier, both together targeting the ''`few-shot'' problem. We design different training strategies of MahiNet for supervised learning and meta-learning. Moreover, we propose two novel benchmark datasets ''mcfsImageNet'' (as a subset of ImageNet) and ''mcfsOmniglot'' (re-splitted Omniglot) specifically for MCFS problem. In experiments, we show that MahiNet outperforms several state-of-the-art models on MCFS classification tasks in both supervised learning and meta-learning scenarios.",

    "abstract": "Recent work has shown increased interest in using the Variational Autoencoder (VAE) framework to discover interpretable representations of data in an unsupervised way. These methods have focussed largely on modifying the variational cost function to achieve this goal. However, we show that methods like beta-VAE simplify the tendency of variational inference to underfit causing pathological over-pruning and over-orthogonalization of learned components. In this paper we take a complementary approach: to modify the probabilistic model to encourage structured latent variable representations to be discovered. Specifically, the standard VAE probabilistic model is unidentifiable: the likelihood of the parameters is invariant under rotations of the latent space. This means there is no pressure to identify each true factor of variation with a latent variable.\nWe therefore employ a rich prior distribution, akin to the ICA model, that breaks the rotational symmetry.\nExtensive quantitative and qualitative experiments demonstrate that the proposed prior mitigates the trade-off introduced by modified cost functions like beta-VAE and TCVAE between reconstruction loss and disentanglement. The proposed prior allows to improve these approaches with respect to both disentanglement and reconstruction quality significantly over the state of the art.",

    "abstract": "We present a novel method to precisely impose tree-structured category information onto word-embeddings, resulting in ball embeddings in higher dimensional spaces (N-balls for short). Inclusion relations among N-balls implicitly encode subordinate relations among categories. The similarity measurement in terms of the cosine function is enriched by category information. Using a geometric construction method instead of back-propagation, we create large N-ball embeddings that satisfy two conditions: (1) category trees are precisely imposed onto word embeddings at zero energy cost; (2) pre-trained word embeddings are well preserved. A new benchmark data set is created for validating the category of unknown words. Experiments show that N-ball embeddings, carrying category information, significantly outperform word embeddings in the test of nearest neighborhoods, and demonstrate surprisingly good performance in validating categories of unknown words.

    "title": "Manifold Mixup: Learning Better Representations by Interpolating Hidden States",
    "abstract": "Deep networks often perform well on the data distribution on which they are trained, yet give incorrect (and often very confident) answers when evaluated on points from off of the training distribution. This is exemplified by the adversarial examples phenomenon but can also be seen in terms of model generalization and domain shift.  Ideally, a model would assign lower confidence to points unlike those from the training distribution.  We propose a regularizer which addresses this issue by training with interpolated hidden states and encouraging the classifier to be less confident at these points.  Because the hidden states are learned, this has an important effect of encouraging the hidden states for a class to be concentrated in such a way so that interpolations within the same class or between two different classes do not intersect with the real data points from other classes.  This has a major advantage in that it avoids the underfitting which can result from interpolating in the input space.  We prove that the exact condition for this problem of underfitting to be avoided by Manifold Mixup is that the dimensionality of the hidden states exceeds the number of classes, which is often the case in practice.  Additionally, this concentration can be seen as making the features in earlier layers more discriminative.  We show that despite requiring no significant additional computation, Manifold Mixup achieves large improvements over strong baselines in supervised learning, robustness to single-step adversarial attacks, semi-supervised learning, and Negative Log-Likelihood on held out samples.",

In this paper, we show that the cross-validation risk is differentiable with respect to the hyperparameters and training data for many common machine learning algorithms, including logistic regression, elastic-net regression, and support vector machines. Leveraging this property of differentiability, we propose a cross-validation gradient method (CVGM) for hyperparameter optimization. Our method enables efficient optimization in high-dimensional hyperparameter spaces of the cross-validation risk, the best surrogate of the true generalization ability of our learning algorithm.",

    "title": "Success at any cost: value constrained model-free continuous control",
    "abstract": "Naively applying Reinforcement Learning algorithms to continuous control problems -- such as locomotion and robot control -- to maximize task reward often results in policies which rely on high-amplitude, high-frequency control signals, known colloquially as bang-bang control. While such policies can implement the optimal solution, particularly in simulated systems, they are often not desirable for real world systems since bang-bang control can lead to increased wear and tear and energy consumption and tends to excite undesired second-order dynamics. To counteract this issue, multi-objective optimization can be used to simultaneously optimize both the reward and some auxiliary cost that discourages undesired (e.g. high-amplitude) control. In principle, such an approach can yield the sought after, smooth, control policies. It can, however, be hard to find the correct trade-off between cost and return that results in the desired behavior. In this paper we propose a new constraint-based approach which defines a lower bound on the return while minimizing one or more costs (such as control effort). We employ Lagrangian relaxation to learn both (a) the parameters of a control policy that satisfies the desired constraints and (b) the Lagrangian multipliers for the optimization. Moreover, we demonstrate policy optimization which satisfies constraints either in expectation or in a per-step fashion, and we learn a single conditional policy that is able to dynamically change the trade-off between return and cost. We demonstrate the efficiency of our approach using a number of continuous control benchmark tasks as well as a realistic, energy-optimized quadruped locomotion task.",

    "title": "Relational Forward Models for Multi-Agent Learning",
    "abstract": "The behavioral dynamics of multi-agent systems have a rich and orderly structure, which can be leveraged to understand these systems, and to improve how artificial agents learn to operate in them. Here we introduce Relational Forward Models (RFM) for multi-agent learning, networks that can learn to make accurate predictions of agents' future behavior in multi-agent environments. Because these models operate on the discrete entities and relations present in the environment, they produce interpretable intermediate representations which offer insights into what drives agents' behavior, and what events mediate the intensity and valence of social interactions. Furthermore, we show that embedding RFM modules inside agents results in faster learning systems compared to non-augmented baselines. \nAs more and more of the autonomous systems we develop and interact with become multi-agent in nature, developing richer analysis tools for characterizing how and why agents make decisions is increasingly necessary. Moreover, developing artificial agents that quickly and safely learn to coordinate with one another, and with humans in shared environments, is crucial.",

    "title": "Von Mises-Fisher Loss for Training Sequence to Sequence Models with Continuous Outputs",
    "abstract": "The Softmax function is used in the final layer of nearly all existing sequence-to-sequence models for language generation. However, it is usually the slowest layer to compute which limits the vocabulary size to a subset of most frequent types; and it has a large memory footprint. We propose a general technique for replacing the softmax layer with a continuous embedding layer. Our primary innovations are a novel probabilistic loss, and a training and inference procedure in which we generate a probability distribution over pre-trained word embeddings, instead of a multinomial distribution over the vocabulary obtained via softmax. We evaluate this new class of sequence-to-sequence models with continuous outputs on the task of neural machine translation. We show that our models obtain upto 2.5x speed-up in training time while performing on par with the state-of-the-art models in terms of translation quality. These models are capable of handling very large vocabularies without compromising on translation quality. They also produce more meaningful errors than in the softmax-based models, as these errors typically lie in a subspace of the vector space of the reference translations.",

    "abstract": "When applying machine learning to sensitive data one has to balance between accuracy, information leakage, and computational-complexity. Recent studies have shown that Homomorphic Encryption (HE) can be used for protecting against information leakage while applying neural networks. However, this comes with the cost of limiting the kind of neural networks that can be used (and hence the accuracy) and with latency of the order of several minutes even for relatively simple networks. In this study we improve on previous results both in the kind of networks that can be applied and in terms of the latency. Most of the improvement is achieved by novel ways to represent the data to make better use of the capabilities of the encryption scheme.",

    "abstract": "As deep CNN classifier performance using ground-truth labels has begun to asymptote at near-perfect levels, a key aim for the field is to extend training paradigms to capture further useful structure in natural image data and improve model robustness and generalization. In this paper, we present a novel natural image benchmark for making this extension, which we call CIFAR10H. This new dataset comprises a human-derived, full distribution over labels for each image of the CIFAR10 test set, offering the ability to assess the generalization of state-of-the-art CIFAR10 models, as well as investigate the effects of including this information in model training. We show that classification models trained on CIFAR10 do not generalize as well to our dataset as it does to traditional extensions, and that models fine-tuned using our label information are able to generalize better to related datasets, complement popular data augmentation schemes, and provide robustness to adversarial attacks. We explain these improvements in terms of better empirical approximations to the expected loss function over natural images and their categories in the visual world.",

    "abstract": "Effective performance of neural networks depends critically on effective tuning of optimization hyperparameters, especially learning rates (and schedules thereof). We present Amortized Proximal Optimization (APO), which takes the perspective that each optimization step should approximately minimize a proximal objective (similar to the ones used to motivate natural gradient and trust region policy optimization). Optimization hyperparameters are adapted to best minimize the proximal objective after one weight update. We show that an idealized version of APO (where an oracle minimizes the proximal objective exactly) achieves global convergence to stationary point and locally second-order convergence to global optimum for neural networks. APO incurs minimal computational overhead. We experiment with using APO to adapt a variety of optimization hyperparameters online during training, including (possibly layer-specific) learning rates, damping coefficients, and gradient variance exponents. For a variety of network architectures and optimization algorithms (including SGD, RMSprop, and K-FAC), we show that with minimal tuning, APO performs competitively with carefully tuned optimizers.",

In this paper, we propose two families of models built on a sequence to sequence model and a memory network model to mimic the k-Nearest Neighbors model, which generate a sequence of labels, a sequence of out-of-sample feature vectors and a final label for classification, and thus they could also function as oversamplers. We also propose `out-of-core' versions of our models which assume that only a small portion of data can be loaded into memory. Computational experiments show that our models outperform k-Nearest Neighbors, a feed-forward neural network and a memory network, due to the fact that our models must produce additional output and not just the label. As an oversampler on imbalanced datasets, the sequence to sequence kNN model often outperforms Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique and Adaptive Synthetic Sampling.\n",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we propose the StochAstic Recursive grAdient Policy Optimization (SARAPO) algorithm which is a novel variance reduction method on Trust Region Policy Optimization (TRPO). The algorithm incorporates the StochAstic Recursive grAdient algoritHm(SARAH) into the TRPO framework. Compared with the existing Stochastic Variance Reduced Policy Optimization (SVRPO), our algorithm is more stable in the variance. Furthermore, by theoretical analysis the ordinary differential equation and the stochastic differential equation (ODE/SDE) of SARAH, we analyze its convergence property and stability. Our experiments demonstrate its performance on a variety of benchmark tasks. We show that our algorithm gets better improvement in each iteration and matches or even outperforms SVRPO and TRPO.\n",

    "abstract": "Computations for the softmax function in neural network models are expensive when the number of output classes is large. This can become a significant issue in both training and inference for such models. In this paper, we present Doubly Sparse Softmax (DS-Softmax), Sparse Mixture of Sparse of Sparse Experts, to improve the efficiency for softmax inference. During training, our method learns a two-level class hierarchy by dividing entire output class space into several partially overlapping experts. Each expert is responsible for a learned subset of the output class space and each output class only belongs to a small number of those experts. During inference, our method quickly locates the most probable expert to compute small-scale softmax. Our method is learning-based and requires no knowledge of the output class partition space a priori. We empirically evaluate our method on several real-world tasks and demonstrate that we can achieve significant computation reductions without loss of performance.",

    "abstract": "We propose Regularized Learning under Label shifts (RLLS), a principled and a practical domain-adaptation algorithm to correct for shifts in the label distribution between a source and a target domain. We first estimate importance weights using labeled source data and unlabeled target data, and then train a classifier on the weighted source samples. We derive a generalization bound for the classifier on the target domain which is independent of the (ambient) data dimensions, and instead only depends on the complexity of the function class. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first generalization bound for the label-shift problem where the labels in the target domain are not available. Based on this bound, we propose a regularized estimator for the small-sample regime which accounts for the uncertainty in the estimated weights. Experiments on the CIFAR-10 and MNIST datasets show that RLLS improves classification accuracy, especially in the low sample and large-shift regimes, compared to previous methods.",

    "abstract": "Neural network pruning techniques can reduce the parameter counts of trained networks by over 90%, decreasing storage requirements and improving computational performance of inference without compromising accuracy. However, contemporary experience is that the sparse architectures produced by pruning are difficult to train from the start, which would similarly improve training performance.\n\nWe find that a standard pruning technique naturally uncovers subnetworks whose initializations made them capable of training effectively. Based on these results, we articulate the \"lottery ticket hypothesis:\" dense, randomly-initialized, feed-forward networks contain subnetworks (\"winning tickets\") that - when trained in isolation - reach test accuracy comparable to the original network in a similar number of iterations. The winning tickets we find have won the initialization lottery: their connections have initial weights that make training particularly effective.\n\nWe present an algorithm to identify winning tickets and a series of experiments that support the lottery ticket hypothesis and the importance of these fortuitous initializations. We consistently find winning tickets that are less than 10-20% of the size of several fully-connected and convolutional feed-forward architectures for MNIST and CIFAR10. Above this size, the winning tickets that we find learn faster than the original network and reach higher test accuracy.",

The method, Discriminative Active Learning (DAL), poses active learning as a binary classification task, attempting to choose examples to label in such a way as to make the labeled set and the unlabeled pool indistinguishable. Experimenting on image classification tasks, we empirically show our method to be on par with state of the art methods in medium and large query batch sizes, while being simple to implement and also extend to other domains besides classification tasks. Our experiments also show that none of the state of the art methods of today are clearly better than uncertainty sampling, negating some of the reported results in the recent literature.",

    "abstract": "Training a neural network for a classification task typically assumes that the data to train are given from the beginning.\nHowever, in the real world, additional data accumulate gradually and the model requires additional training without accessing the old training data. This usually leads to the catastrophic forgetting problem which is inevitable for the traditional training methodology of neural networks.\nIn this paper, we propose a memory-based continual learning method that is able to learn additional tasks while retaining the performance of previously learned tasks.\nComposed of two complementary networks, the Hippocampus-Net (H-Net) and the Cortex-Net (C-Net), our model estimates the index of the corresponding task for an input sample and utilizes a particular portion of itself with the estimated index.\nThe C-Net guarantees no degradation in the performance of the previously learned tasks and the H-Net shows high confidence in finding the origin of an input sample.",

    "title": "On Inductive Biases in Deep Reinforcement Learning",
    "abstract": "Many deep reinforcement learning algorithms contain inductive biases that sculpt the agent's objective and its interface to the environment. These inductive biases can take many forms, including domain knowledge and pretuned hyper-parameters. In general, there is a trade-off between generality and performance when we use such biases. Stronger biases can lead to faster learning, but weaker biases can potentially lead to more general algorithms that work on a wider class of problems.\nThis trade-off is relevant because these inductive biases are not free; substantial effort may be required to obtain relevant domain knowledge or to tune hyper-parameters effectively. In this paper, we re-examine several domain-specific components that modify the agent's objective and environmental interface.  We investigated whether the performance deteriorates when all these fixed components are replaced with adaptive solutions from the literature.  In our experiments, performance sometimes decreased with the adaptive components, as one might expect when comparing to components crafted for the domain, but sometimes the adaptive components performed better. We then investigated the main benefit of having fewer domain-specific components, by comparing the learning performance of the two systems on a different set of continuous control problems, without additional tuning of either system.  As hypothesized, the system with adaptive components performed better on many of the tasks.",

    "title": "Backprop with Approximate Activations for Memory-efficient Network Training",
    "abstract": "With innovations in architecture design, deeper and wider neural network models deliver improved performance on a diverse variety of tasks. But the increased memory footprint of these models presents a challenge during training, when all intermediate layer activations need to be stored for back-propagation. Limited GPU memory forces practitioners to make sub-optimal choices: either train inefficiently with smaller batches of examples; or limit the architecture to have lower depth and width, and fewer layers at higher spatial resolutions. This work introduces an approximation strategy that significantly reduces a network's memory footprint during training, but has negligible effect on training performance and computational expense. During the forward pass, we replace activations with lower-precision approximations immediately after they have been used by subsequent layers, thus freeing up memory. The approximate activations are then used during the backward pass. This approach limits the accumulation of errors across the forward and backward pass---because the forward computation across the network still happens at full precision, and the approximation has a limited effect when computing gradients to a layer's input. Experiments, on CIFAR and ImageNet, show that using our approach with 8- and even 4-bit fixed-point approximations of 32-bit floating-point activations has only a minor effect on training and validation performance, while affording significant savings in memory usage.",

    "abstract": "Real-life control tasks involve matters of various substances---rigid or soft bodies, liquid, gas---each with distinct physical behaviors. This poses challenges to traditional rigid-body physics engines. Particle-based simulators have been developed to model the dynamics of these complex scenes; however, relying on approximation techniques, their simulation often deviates from real-world physics, especially in the long term. In this paper, we propose to learn a particle-based simulator for complex control tasks. Combining learning with particle-based systems brings in two major benefits: first, the learned simulator, just like other particle-based systems, acts widely on objects of different materials; second, the particle-based representation poses strong inductive bias for learning: particles of the same type have the same dynamics within. This enables the model to quickly adapt to new environments of unknown dynamics within a few observations. We demonstrate robots achieving complex manipulation tasks using the learned simulator, such as manipulating fluids and deformable foam, with experiments both in simulation and in the real world. Our study helps lay the foundation for robot learning of dynamic scenes with particle-based representations.",

    "title": "CHEMICAL NAMES STANDARDIZATION USING NEURAL SEQUENCE TO SEQUENCE MODEL",
    "abstract": "Chemical information extraction is to convert chemical knowledge in text into true chemical database, which is a text processing task heavily relying on chemical compound name identification and standardization. Once a systematic name for a chemical compound is given, it will naturally and much simply convert the name into the eventually required molecular formula. However, for many chemical substances, they have been shown in many other names besides their systematic names which poses a great challenge for this task. In this paper, we propose a framework to do the auto standardization from the non-systematic names to the corresponding systematic names by using the spelling error correction, byte pair encoding tokenization and neural sequence to sequence model. Our framework is trained end to end and is fully data-driven. Our standardization accuracy on the test dataset achieves 54.04% which has a great improvement compared to previous state-of-the-art result.",

    "title": "Learning Implicitly Recurrent CNNs Through Parameter Sharing",
    "abstract": "We introduce a parameter sharing scheme, in which different layers of a convolutional neural network (CNN) are defined by a learned linear combination of parameter tensors from a global bank of templates.  Restricting the number of templates yields a flexible hybridization of traditional CNNs and recurrent networks.  Compared to traditional CNNs, we demonstrate substantial parameter savings on standard image classification tasks, while maintaining accuracy.\nOur simple parameter sharing scheme, though defined via soft weights, in practice often yields trained networks with near strict recurrent structure; with negligible side effects, they convert into networks with actual loops. Training these networks thus implicitly involves discovery of suitable recurrent architectures. Though considering only the aspect of recurrent links, our trained networks achieve accuracy competitive with those built using state-of-the-art neural architecture search (NAS) procedures.\nOur hybridization of recurrent and convolutional networks may also represent a beneficial architectural bias.  Specifically, on synthetic tasks which are algorithmic in nature, our hybrid networks both train faster and extrapolate better to test examples outside the span of the training set.",

    "abstract": "Extracting relevant information, causally inferring and predicting the future states with high accuracy is a crucial task for modeling complex systems. The endeavor to address these tasks is made even more challenging when we have to deal with high-dimensional heterogeneous data streams. Such data streams often have higher-order inter-dependencies across spatial and temporal dimensions. We propose to perform a soft-clustering of the data and learn its dynamics to produce a compact dynamical model while still ensuring the original objectives of causal inference and accurate predictions. To efficiently and rigorously process the dynamics of soft-clustering, we advocate for an information theory inspired approach that incorporates stochastic calculus and seeks to determine a trade-off between the predictive accuracy and compactness of the mathematical representation. We cast the model construction as a maximization of the compression of the state variables such that the predictive ability and causal interdependence (relatedness) constraints between the original data streams and the compact model are closely bounded. We provide theoretical guarantees concerning the convergence of the proposed learning algorithm. To further test the proposed framework, we consider a high-dimensional Gaussian case study and describe an iterative scheme for updating the new model parameters. Using numerical experiments, we demonstrate the benefits on compression and prediction accuracy for a class of dynamical systems. Finally, we apply the proposed algorithm to the real-world dataset of multimodal sentiment intensity and show improvements in prediction with reduced dimensions.",

    "title": "The Comparative Power of ReLU Networks and Polynomial Kernels in the Presence of Sparse Latent Structure",
    "abstract": "There has been a large amount of interest, both in the past and particularly recently, into the relative advantage of different families of universal function approximators, for instance neural networks, polynomials, rational functions, etc. However, current research has focused almost exclusively on understanding this problem in a worst case setting: e.g. characterizing the best L1 or L_{infty} approximation in a box (or sometimes, even under an adversarially constructed data distribution.) In this setting many classical tools from approximation theory can be effectively used.\n\nHowever, in typical applications we expect data to be high dimensional, but structured -- so, it would only be important to approximate the desired function well on the relevant part of its domain, e.g. a small manifold on which real input data actually lies. Moreover, even within this domain the desired quality of approximation may not be uniform; for instance in classification problems, the approximation needs to be more accurate near the decision boundary. These issues, to the best of our knowledge, have remain unexplored until now.\n\t\nWith this in mind, we analyze the performance of neural networks and polynomial kernels in a natural regression setting where the data enjoys sparse latent structure, and the labels depend in a simple way on the latent variables. We give an almost-tight theoretical analysis of the performance of both neural networks and polynomials for this problem, as well as verify our theory with simulations. Our results both involve new (complex-analytic) techniques, which may be of independent interest, and show substantial qualitative differences with what is known in the worst-case setting.",

In light of recent work on hypergradient methods (Baydin et al., 2018), we revisit these claims to see if such methods close the gap between the most popular optimizers. As a byproduct, we analyze the true benefit of these hypergradient methods compared to more classical schedules, such as the fixed decay of Wilson et al. (2017). In particular, we observe they are of marginal help since their performance varies significantly when tuning their hyperparameters. Finally, as robustness is a critical quality of an optimizer, we provide a sensitivity analysis of these gradient based optimizers to assess how challenging their tuning is.",

    "abstract": "In this work, we propose a composition/decomposition framework for adversarially training generative models on composed data - data where each sample can be thought of as being constructed from a fixed number of components. In our framework, samples are generated by sampling components from component generators and feeding these components to a composition function which combines them into a “composed sample”. This compositional training approach improves the modularity, extensibility and interpretability of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) - providing a principled way to incrementally construct complex models out of simpler component models, and allowing for explicit “division of responsibility” between these components. Using this framework, we define a family of learning tasks and evaluate their feasibility on two datasets in two different data modalities (image and text). Lastly, we derive sufficient conditions such that these compositional generative models are identifiable. Our work provides a principled approach to building on pretrained generative models or for exploiting the compositional nature of data distributions to train extensible and interpretable models.\n",

Our model builds an object-based scene representation and translates sentences into executable, symbolic programs. To bridge the learning of two modules, we use a neuro-symbolic reasoning module that executes these programs on the latent scene representation. Analogical to human concept learning, the perception module learns visual concepts based on the language description of the object being referred to. Meanwhile, the learned visual concepts facilitate learning new words and parsing new sentences. We use curriculum learning to guide the searching over the large compositional space of images and language. Extensive experiments demonstrate the accuracy and efficiency of our model on learning visual concepts, word representations, and semantic parsing of sentences. Further, our method allows easy generalization to new object attributes, compositions, language concepts, scenes and questions, and even new program domains. It also empowers applications including visual question answering and bidirectional image-text retrieval.",

We postulate that in the absence of useful reward signals, an effective exploration strategy should seek out {\\it decision states}. These states lie at critical junctions in the state space from where the agent can transition to new, potentially unexplored regions. We propose to learn about decision states from prior experience. By training a goal-conditioned model with an information bottleneck, we can identify decision states by examining where the model accesses the goal state through the bottleneck. We find that this simple mechanism effectively identifies decision states, even in partially observed settings. In effect, the model learns the sensory cues that correlate with potential subgoals. In new environments, this model can then identify novel subgoals for further exploration, guiding the agent through a sequence of potential decision  states and through new regions of the state space.",

Yet, perhaps surprisingly, there is no generally agreed-upon protocol for the quantitative and reproducible evaluation of optimization strategies for deep learning.

As the primary contribution, we present DeepOBS, a Python package of deep learning optimization benchmarks. The package addresses key challenges in the quantitative assessment of stochastic optimizers, and automates most steps of benchmarking. The library includes a wide and extensible set of ready-to-use realistic optimization problems, such as training Residual Networks for image classification on ImageNet or character-level language prediction models, as well as popular classics like MNIST and CIFAR-10. The package also provides realistic baseline results for the most popular optimizers on these test problems, ensuring a fair comparison to the competition when benchmarking new optimizers, and without having to run costly experiments. It comes with output back-ends that directly produce LaTeX code for inclusion in academic publications. It supports TensorFlow and is available open source.",

    "title": "Learning Embeddings into Entropic Wasserstein Spaces",
    "abstract": "Despite their prevalence, Euclidean embeddings of data are fundamentally limited in their ability to capture latent semantic structures, which need not conform to Euclidean spatial assumptions. Here we consider an alternative, which embeds data as discrete probability distributions in a Wasserstein space, endowed with an optimal transport metric. Wasserstein spaces are much larger and more flexible than Euclidean spaces, in that they can successfully embed a wider variety of metric structures. We propose to exploit this flexibility by learning an embedding that captures the semantic information in the Wasserstein distance between embedded distributions. We examine empirically the representational capacity of such learned Wasserstein embeddings, showing that they can embed a wide variety of complex metric structures with smaller distortion than an equivalent Euclidean embedding. We also investigate an application to word embedding, demonstrating a unique advantage of Wasserstein embeddings: we can directly visualize the high-dimensional embedding, as it is a probability distribution on a low-dimensional space. This obviates the need for dimensionality reduction techniques such as t-SNE for visualization.",

    "title": "Approximability of Discriminators Implies Diversity in GANs",
    "abstract": "While Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have empirically produced impressive results on learning complex real-world distributions, recent works have shown that they suffer from lack of diversity or mode collapse. The theoretical work of Arora et al. (2017a) suggests a dilemma about GANs’ statistical properties: powerful discriminators cause overfitting, whereas weak discriminators cannot detect mode collapse.\nBy contrast, we show in this paper that GANs can in principle learn distributions in Wasserstein distance (or KL-divergence in many cases) with polynomial sample complexity, if the discriminator class has strong distinguishing power against the particular generator class (instead of against all possible generators). For various generator classes such as mixture of Gaussians, exponential families, and invertible and injective neural networks generators, we design corresponding discriminators (which are often neural nets of specific architectures) such that the Integral Probability Metric (IPM) induced by the discriminators can provably approximate the Wasserstein distance and/or KL-divergence. This implies that if the training is successful, then the learned distribution is close to the true distribution in Wasserstein distance or KL divergence, and thus cannot drop modes. Our preliminary experiments show that on synthetic datasets the test IPM is well correlated with KL divergence or the Wasserstein distance, indicating that the lack of diversity in GANs may be caused by the sub-optimality in optimization instead of statistical inefficiency.",

    "abstract": "Binary neural networks using the Straight-Through-Estimator (STE) have been shown to achieve state-of-the-art results, but their training process is not well-founded. This is due to the discrepancy between the evaluated function in the forward path, and the weight updates in the back-propagation, updates which do not correspond to gradients of the forward path. Efficient convergence and accuracy of binary models often rely on careful fine-tuning and various ad-hoc techniques. In this work, we empirically identify and study the effectiveness of the various ad-hoc techniques commonly used in the literature, providing best-practices for efficient training of binary models. We show that adapting learning rates using second moment methods is crucial for the successful use of the STE, and that other optimisers can easily get stuck in local minima. We also find that many of the commonly employed tricks are only effective towards the end of the training, with these methods making early stages of the training considerably slower. Our analysis disambiguates necessary from unnecessary ad-hoc techniques for training of binary neural networks, paving the way for future development of solid theoretical foundations for these. Our newly-found insights further lead to new procedures which make training of existing binary neural networks notably faster.",

    "title": "Like What You Like: Knowledge Distill via Neuron Selectivity Transfer",
    "abstract": "Despite deep neural networks have demonstrated extraordinary power in various applications, their superior performances are at expense of high storage and computational costs. Consequently, the acceleration and compression of neural networks have attracted much attention recently. Knowledge Transfer (KT), which aims at training a smaller student network by transferring knowledge from a larger teacher model, is one of the popular solutions. In this paper, we propose a novel knowledge transfer method by treating it as a distribution matching problem. Particularly, we match the distributions of neuron selectivity patterns between teacher and student networks. To achieve this goal, we devise a new KT loss function by minimizing the Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) metric between these distributions. Combined with the original loss function, our method can significantly improve the performance of student networks. We validate the effectiveness of our method across several datasets, and further combine it with other KT methods to explore the best possible results. Last but not least, we fine-tune the model to other tasks such as object detection. The results are also encouraging, which confirm the transferability of the learned features.",

    "abstract": "We propose a simple and robust training-free approach for building sentence representations. Inspired by the Gram-Schmidt Process in geometric theory, we build an orthogonal basis of the subspace spanned by a word and its surrounding context in a sentence. We model the semantic meaning of a word in a sentence based on two aspects. One is its relatedness to the word vector subspace already spanned by its contextual words. The other is its novel semantic meaning which shall be introduced as a new basis vector perpendicular to this existing subspace.  Following this motivation, we develop an innovative method based on orthogonal basis to combine pre-trained word embeddings into sentence representation. This approach requires zero training and zero parameters, along with efficient inference performance. We evaluate our approach on 11 downstream NLP tasks. Experimental results show that our model outperforms all existing zero-training alternatives in all the tasks and it is competitive to other approaches relying on either large amounts of labelled data or prolonged training time.",

    "abstract": "Generative adversarial networks (GANs) have achieved great success at generating realistic images. However, the text generation still remains a challenging task for modern GAN architectures. In this work, we propose RelGAN, a new GAN architecture for text generation, consisting of three main components: a relational memory based generator for the long-distance dependency modeling, the Gumbel-Softmax relaxation for training GANs on discrete data, and multiple embedded representations in the discriminator to provide a more informative signal for the generator updates. Our experiments show that RelGAN outperforms current state-of-the-art models in terms of sample quality and diversity, and we also reveal via ablation studies that each component of RelGAN contributes critically to its performance improvements. Moreover, a key advantage of our method, that distinguishes it from other GANs, is the ability to control the trade-off between sample quality and diversity via the use of a single adjustable parameter. Finally, RelGAN is the first architecture that makes GANs with Gumbel-Softmax relaxation succeed in generating realistic text.",

    "abstract": "The construction of adversarial images is a search problem in high dimensions within a small region around a target image. The goal is to find an imperceptibly modified image that is misclassified by a target model. In the black-box setting, only sporadic feedback is provided through occasional model evaluations. In this paper we provide a new algorithm whose search strategy is based on an intriguingly simple iterative principle: We randomly pick a low frequency component of the discrete cosine transform (DCT) and either add or subtract it to the target image. Model evaluations are only required to identify whether an operation decreases the adversarial loss. Despite its simplicity, the proposed method can be used for targeted and untargeted attacks --- resulting in previously unprecedented query efficiency in both settings. We require a median of 600 black-box model queries (ResNet-50) to produce an adversarial ImageNet image, and we successfully attack Google Cloud Vision with 2500 median queries, averaging to a cost of only $3 per image. We argue that our proposed algorithm should serve as a strong baseline for future adversarial black-box attacks, in particular because it is extremely fast and can be implemented in less than 20 lines of PyTorch code.

We introduce the BabyAI research platform, with the goal of supporting investigations towards including humans in the loop for grounded language learning. The BabyAI platform comprises an extensible suite of 19 levels of increasing difficulty. Each level gradually leads the agent towards acquiring a combinatorially rich synthetic language, which is a proper subset of English. The platform also provides a hand-crafted bot agent, which simulates a human teacher.  We report estimated amount of supervision required for training neural reinforcement and behavioral-cloning agents on some BabyAI levels. We put forward strong evidence that current deep learning methods are not yet sufficiently sample-efficient in the context of learning a language with compositional properties.",

As such, researchers have demonstrated DNNs are vulnerable to small input perturbation, i.e., adversarial attacks. This work proposes the effective path as a new approach to exploring DNNs' internal organization. The effective path is an ensemble of synapses and neurons, which is reconstructed from a trained DNN using our activation-based backward algorithm. The per-image effective path can be aggregated to the class-level effective path, through which we observe that adversarial images activate effective path different from normal images. We propose an effective path similarity-based method to detect adversarial images and demonstrate its high accuracy and broad applicability.\n",

    "abstract": "Music relies heavily on repetition to build structure and meaning.  Self-reference occurs on multiple timescales, from motifs to phrases to reusing of entire sections of music, such as in pieces with ABA structure.  The Transformer (Vaswani et al., 2017), a sequence model based on self-attention, has achieved compelling results in many generation tasks that require maintaining long-range coherence. This suggests that self-attention might also be well-suited to modeling music. In musical composition and performance, however, relative timing is critically important.  Existing approaches for representing relative positional information in the Transformer modulate attention based on pairwise distance (Shaw et al., 2018).  This is impractical for long sequences such as musical compositions since their memory complexity is quadratic in the sequence length.  We propose an algorithm that reduces the intermediate memory requirements to linear in the sequence length. This enables us to demonstrate that a Transformer with our modified relative attention mechanism can generate minute-long (thousands of steps) compositions with compelling structure, generate continuations that coherently elaborate on a given motif, and in a seq2seq setup generate accompaniments conditioned on melodies.   We evaluate the Transformer with our relative attention mechanism on two datasets, JSB Chorales and Piano-e-competition, and obtain state-of-the-art results on the latter.",

    "abstract": "Deep reinforcement learning has enabled robots to complete complex tasks in simulation. However, the resulting policies do not transfer to real robots due to model errors in the simulator. One solution is to randomize the simulation environment, so that the resulting, trained policy achieves high performance in expectation over a variety of configurations that could represent the real-world. However, the distribution over simulator configurations must be carefully selected to represent the relevant dynamic modes of the system, as otherwise it can be unlikely to sample challenging configurations frequently enough. Moreover, the ideal distribution to improve the policy changes as the policy (un)learns to solve tasks in certain configurations. In this paper, we propose to use an inexpensive, kernel-based summarization method method that identifies configurations that lead to diverse behaviors. Since failure modes for the given task are naturally diverse, the policy trains on a mixture of representative and challenging configurations, which leads to more robust policies. In experiments, we show that the proposed method achieves the same performance as domain randomization in simple cases, but performs better when domain randomization does not lead to diverse dynamic modes.",

    "title": "Unsupervised Discovery of Parts, Structure, and Dynamics",
    "abstract": "Humans easily recognize object parts and their hierarchical structure by watching how they move; they can then predict how each part moves in the future. In this paper, we propose a novel formulation that simultaneously learns a hierarchical, disentangled object representation and a dynamics model for object parts from unlabeled videos. Our Parts, Structure, and Dynamics (PSD) model learns to, first, recognize the object parts via a layered image representation; second, predict hierarchy via a structural descriptor that composes low-level concepts into a hierarchical structure; and third, model the system dynamics by predicting the future. Experiments on multiple real and synthetic datasets demonstrate that our PSD model works well on all three tasks: segmenting object parts, building their hierarchical structure, and capturing their motion distributions.",

    "title": "Slalom: Fast, Verifiable and Private Execution of Neural Networks in Trusted Hardware",
    "abstract": "As Machine Learning (ML) gets applied to security-critical or sensitive domains, there is a growing need for integrity and privacy for outsourced ML computations. A pragmatic solution comes from Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs), which use hardware and software protections to isolate sensitive computations from the untrusted software stack. However, these isolation guarantees come at a price in performance, compared to untrusted alternatives. This paper initiates the study of high performance execution of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) in TEEs by efficiently partitioning DNN computations between trusted and untrusted devices. Building upon an efficient outsourcing scheme for matrix multiplication, we propose Slalom, a framework that securely delegates execution of all linear layers in a DNN from a TEE (e.g., Intel SGX or Sanctum) to a faster, yet untrusted, co-located processor. We evaluate Slalom by running DNNs in an Intel SGX enclave, which selectively delegates work to an untrusted GPU. For canonical DNNs (VGG16, MobileNet and ResNet variants) we obtain 6x to 20x increases in throughput for verifiable inference, and 4x to 11x for verifiable and private inference.",

    "abstract": "Many real-world problems, e.g. object detection, have outputs that are naturally expressed as sets of entities. This creates a challenge for traditional deep neural networks which naturally deal with structured outputs such as vectors, matrices or tensors. We present a novel approach for learning to predict sets with unknown permutation and cardinality using deep neural networks. Specifically, in our formulation we incorporate the permutation as unobservable variable and estimate its distribution during the learning process using alternating optimization. We demonstrate the validity of this new formulation on two relevant vision problems: object detection, for which our formulation outperforms state-of-the-art detectors such as Faster R-CNN and YOLO, and a complex CAPTCHA test, where we observe that, surprisingly, our set based network acquired the ability of mimicking arithmetics without any rules being coded.",

    "title": "Large-Scale Study of Curiosity-Driven Learning",
    "abstract": "Reinforcement learning algorithms rely on carefully engineered rewards from the environment that are extrinsic to the agent. However, annotating each environment with hand-designed, dense rewards is difficult and not scalable, motivating the need for developing reward functions that are intrinsic to the agent. \nCuriosity is such intrinsic reward function which uses prediction error as a reward signal. In this paper: (a) We perform the first large-scale study of purely curiosity-driven learning, i.e. {\\em without any extrinsic rewards}, across $54$ standard benchmark environments, including the Atari game suite. Our results show surprisingly good performance as well as a high degree of alignment between the intrinsic curiosity objective and the hand-designed extrinsic rewards of many games. (b) We investigate the effect of using different feature spaces for computing prediction error and show that random features are sufficient for many popular RL game benchmarks, but learned features appear to generalize better (e.g. to novel game levels in Super Mario Bros.). (c) We demonstrate limitations of the prediction-based rewards in stochastic setups. Game-play videos and code are at https://doubleblindsupplementary.github.io/large-curiosity/.",

    "abstract": "Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), though powerful, is hard to train. Several recent works (Brock et al., 2016; Miyato et al., 2018) suggest that controlling the spectra of weight matrices in the discriminator can significantly improve the training of GANs. Motivated by their discovery, we propose a new framework for training GANs, which allows more flexible spectrum control (e.g., making the weight matrices of the discriminator have slow singular value decays). Specifically, we propose a new reparameterization approach for the weight matrices of the discriminator in GANs, which allows us to directly manipulate the spectra of the weight matrices through various regularizers and constraints, without intensively computing singular value decompositions. Theoretically, we further show that the spectrum control improves the generalization ability of GANs. Our experiments on CIFAR-10, STL-10, and ImgaeNet datasets confirm that compared to other competitors, our proposed method is capable of generating images with better or equal quality by utilizing spectral normalization and encouraging the slow singular value decay.",

    "abstract": "Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are a promising approach to language generation. The latest works introducing novel GAN models for language generation use n-gram based metrics for evaluation and only report single scores of the best run. In this paper, we argue that this often misrepresents the true picture and does not tell the full story, as GAN models can be extremely sensitive to the random initialization and small deviations from the best hyperparameter choice. In particular, we demonstrate that the previously used BLEU score is not sensitive to semantic deterioration of generated texts and propose alternative metrics that better capture the quality and diversity of the generated samples. We also conduct a set of experiments comparing a number of GAN models for text with a conventional Language Model (LM) and find that none of the considered models performs convincingly better than the LM.",

    "title": "A Deep Learning Approach for Dynamic Survival Analysis with Competing Risks",
    "abstract": "Currently available survival analysis methods are limited in their ability to deal with complex, heterogeneous, and longitudinal data such as that available in primary care records, or in their ability to deal with multiple competing risks. This paper develops a novel deep learning architecture that flexibly incorporates the available longitudinal data comprising various repeated measurements (rather than only the last available measurements) in order to issue dynamically updated survival predictions for one or multiple competing risk(s). Unlike existing works in the survival analysis on the basis of longitudinal data, the proposed method learns the time-to-event distributions without specifying underlying stochastic assumptions of the longitudinal or the time-to-event processes. Thus, our method is able to learn associations between the longitudinal data and the various associated risks in a fully data-driven fashion. We demonstrate the power of our method by applying it to real-world longitudinal datasets and show a drastic improvement over state-of-the-art methods in discriminative performance. Furthermore, our analysis of the variable importance and dynamic survival predictions will yield a better understanding of the predicted risks which will result in more effective health care.",

We\nstudy next-frame video prediction using a deep-learning-based predictive coding\nframework that uses convolutional, long short-term memory (convLSTM) modules.\nWe introduce a novel reduced-gate convolutional LSTM architecture. Our\nreduced-gate model achieves better next-frame prediction accuracy than the original\nconvolutional LSTM while using a smaller parameter budget, thereby reducing\ntraining time. We tested our reduced gate modules within a predictive coding architecture\non the moving MNIST and KITTI datasets. We found that our reduced-gate\nmodel has a significant reduction of approximately 40 percent of the total\nnumber of training parameters and training time in comparison with the standard\nLSTM model which makes it attractive for hardware implementation especially\non small devices.",

    "abstract": "Despite impressive performance as evaluated on i.i.d. holdout data, deep neural networks depend heavily on superficial statistics of the training data and are liable to break under distribution shift. For example, subtle changes to the background or texture of an image can break a seemingly powerful classifier. Building on previous work on domain generalization, we hope to produce a classifier that will generalize to previously unseen domains, even when domain identifiers are not available during training. This setting is challenging because the model may extract many distribution-specific (superficial) signals together with distribution-agnostic (semantic) signals. To overcome this challenge, we incorporate the gray-level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) to extract patterns that our prior knowledge suggests are superficial: they are sensitive to the texture but unable to capture the gestalt of an image. Then we introduce two techniques for improving our networks' out-of-sample performance. The first method is built on the reverse gradient method that pushes our model to learn representations from which the GLCM representation is not predictable. The second method is built on the independence introduced by projecting the model's representation onto the subspace orthogonal to GLCM representation's.\nWe test our method on the battery of standard domain generalization data sets and, interestingly, achieve comparable or better performance as compared to other domain generalization methods that explicitly require samples from the target distribution for training.",

    "title": "SSoC: Learning Spontaneous and Self-Organizing Communication for Multi-Agent Collaboration",
    "abstract": "Multi-agent collaboration is required by numerous real-world problems. Although distributed setting is usually adopted by practical systems, local range communication and information aggregation still matter in fulfilling complex tasks. For multi-agent reinforcement learning, many previous studies have been dedicated to design an effective communication architecture. However, existing models usually suffer from an ossified communication structure, e.g., most of them predefine a particular communication mode by specifying a fixed time frequency and spatial scope for agents to communicate regardless of necessity. Such design is incapable of dealing with multi-agent scenarios that are capricious and complicated, especially when only partial information is available. Motivated by this, we argue that the solution is to build a spontaneous and self-organizing communication (SSoC) learning scheme. By treating the communication behaviour as an explicit action, SSoC learns to organize communication in an effective and efficient way. Particularly, it enables each agent to spontaneously decide when and who to send messages based on its observed states. In this way, a dynamic inter-agent communication channel is established in an online and self-organizing manner. The agents also learn how to adaptively aggregate the received messages and its own hidden states to execute actions. Various experiments have been conducted to demonstrate that SSoC really learns intelligent message passing among agents located far apart. With such agile communications, we observe that effective collaboration tactics emerge which have not been mastered by the compared baselines.",

    "abstract": "We develop a probabilistic extension of state-of-the-art embedding models for link prediction in relational knowledge graphs. Knowledge graphs are collections of relational facts, where each fact states that a certain relation holds between two entities, such as people, places, or objects. We argue that knowledge graphs should be treated within a Bayesian framework because even large knowledge graphs typically contain only few facts per entity, leading effectively to a small data problem where parameter uncertainty matters. We introduce a probabilistic reinterpretation of the DistMult (Yang et al., 2015) and ComplEx (Trouillon et al., 2016) models and employ variational inference to estimate a lower bound on the marginal likelihood of the data. We find that the main benefit of the Bayesian approach is that it allows for efficient, gradient based optimization over hyperparameters, which would lead to divergences in a non-Bayesian treatment. Models with such learned hyperparameters improve over the state-of-the-art by a significant margin, as we demonstrate on several benchmarks.",

In pursuit of this objective, we introduce the General Language Understanding Evaluation (GLUE) benchmark, a collection of tools for evaluating the performance of models across a diverse set of existing NLU tasks. By including tasks with limited training data, GLUE is designed to favor and encourage models that share general linguistic knowledge across tasks. GLUE also includes a hand-crafted diagnostic test suite that enables detailed linguistic analysis of models. We evaluate baselines based on current methods for transfer and representation learning and find that multi-task training on all tasks performs better than training a separate model per task. However, the low absolute performance of our best model indicates the need for improved general NLU systems.",

    "title": "VARIATIONAL SGD: DROPOUT , GENERALIZATION AND CRITICAL POINT AT THE END OF CONVEXITY",
    "abstract": "The goal of the paper is to propose an algorithm for learning the most generalizable solution from given training data. It is shown that Bayesian approach leads to a solution that dependent on statistics of training data and not on particular\nsamples. The solution is stable under perturbations of training data because it is defined by an integral contribution of multiple maxima of the likelihood and not by a single global maximum. Specifically, the Bayesian probability distribution\nof parameters (weights) of a probabilistic model given by a neural network is estimated via recurrent variational approximations. Derived recurrent update rules correspond to SGD-type rules for finding a minimum of an effective loss that is an average of an original negative log-likelihood over the Gaussian distributions of weights, which makes it a function of means and variances. The effective loss is convex for large variances and non-convex in the limit of small variances. Among stationary solutions of the update rules there are trivial solutions with zero variances at local minima of the original loss and a single non-trivial solution with finite variances that is a critical point at the end of convexity of the effective loss\nin the mean-variance space. At the critical point both first- and second-order gradients of the effective loss w.r.t. means are zero. The empirical study confirms that the critical point represents the most generalizable solution. While the location of\nthe critical point in the weight space depends on specifics of the used probabilistic model some properties at the critical point are universal and model independent.",

    "abstract": "We consider the fundamental problem of semi-supervised node classification in attributed graphs with a focus on \\emph{few-shot} learning. Here, we propose Structural Regularized Graph Convolutional Networks (SRGCN), novel neural network architectures extending the well-known GCN structures by stacking transposed convolutional layers for reconstruction of input features. We add a reconstruction error term in the loss function as a regularizer. Unlike standard regularization such as $L_1$ or $L_2$, which controls the model complexity by including a penalty term depends solely on parameters, our regularization function is parameterized by a trainable neural network whose structure depends on the topology of the underlying graph. The new approach effectively addresses the shortcomings of previous graph convolution-based techniques for learning classifiers in the few-shot regime and significantly improves generalization performance over original GCNs when the number of labeled samples is insufficient. Experimental studies on three challenging benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed approach has matched state-of-the-art results and can improve classification accuracies by a notable margin when there are very few examples from each class.",

    "title": "Text Infilling",
    "abstract": "Recent years have seen remarkable progress of text generation in different contexts, including the most common setting of generating text from scratch, the increasingly popular paradigm of retrieval and editing, and others. Text infilling, which fills missing text portions of a sentence or paragraph, is also of numerous use in real life. Previous work has focused on restricted settings, by either assuming single word per missing portion, or limiting to single missing portion to the end of text. This paper studies the general task of text infilling, where the input text can have an arbitrary number of portions to be filled, each of which may require an arbitrary unknown number of tokens. \nWe develop a self-attention model with segment-aware position encoding for precise global context modeling.\nWe further create a variety of supervised data by masking out text in different domains with varying missing ratios and mask strategies. Extensive experiments show the proposed model performs significantly better than other methods, and generates meaningful text patches.",

    "title": "Understanding the Effectiveness of Lipschitz-Continuity in Generative Adversarial Nets",
    "abstract": "In this paper, we investigate the underlying factor that leads to the failure and success in training of GANs. Specifically, we study the property of the optimal discriminative function $f^*(x)$ and show that $f^*(x)$ in most GANs can only reflect the local densities at $x$, which means the value of $f^*(x)$ for points in the fake distribution ($P_g$) does not contain any information useful about the location of other points in the real distribution ($P_r$). Given that the supports of the real and fake distributions are usually disjoint, we argue that such a $f^*(x)$ and its gradient tell nothing about \"how to pull $P_g$ to $P_r$\", which turns out to be the fundamental cause of failure in training of GANs. We further demonstrate that a well-defined distance metric (including the dual form of Wasserstein distance with a compacted constraint) does not necessarily ensure the convergence of GANs. Finally, we propose Lipschitz-continuity condition as a general solution and show that in a large family of GAN objectives, Lipschitz condition is capable of connecting $P_g$ and $P_r$ through $f^*(x)$ such that the gradient $\\nabla_{\\!x}f^*(x)$ at each sample $x \\sim P_g$ points towards some real sample $y \\sim P_r$.",

    "abstract": "Machine learning (ML) research has investigated prototypes: examples that are representative of the behavior to be learned. We systematically evaluate five methods for identifying prototypes, both ones previously introduced as well as new ones we propose, finding all of them to provide meaningful but different interpretations. Through a human study, we confirm that all five metrics are well matched to human intuition. Examining cases where the metrics disagree offers an informative perspective on the properties of data and algorithms used in learning, with implications for data-corpus construction, efficiency, adversarial robustness, interpretability, and other ML aspects. In particular, we confirm that the \"train on hard\" curriculum approach can improve accuracy on many datasets and tasks, but that it is strictly worse when there are many mislabeled or ambiguous examples.",

Using the MNIST and Fashion-MNISTdatasets we show that the embedding not only provides better reconstruction andclassification performance than the current state-of-the-art, but it also allows us toexploit the semantic content of the pretrained word embedding spaces to do taskssuch as image generation from labels outside of those seen during training.",

We introduce differential equation networks, an\nimprovement to modern neural networks in which each neuron learns the\nparticular nonlinear activation function that it requires. We show\nthat enabling each neuron with the ability to learn its own activation\nfunction results in a more compact network capable of achieving\ncomperable, if not superior performance when compared to much larger\nnetworks. We\nalso showcase the capability of a differential equation neuron to\nlearn behaviors, such as oscillation, currently only obtainable by a\nlarge group of neurons. The ability of\ndifferential equation networks to essentially compress a large neural network, without loss of overall performance\nmakes them suitable for on-device applications, where predictions must\nbe computed locally. Our experimental evaluation of real-world and toy\ndatasets show that differential equation networks outperform fixed activatoin networks in several areas.",

Hence, they provide an opportunity to explore theorem proving with human supervision. We use GamePad to synthesize proofs for a simple algebraic rewrite problem and train baseline models for a formalization of the Feit-Thompson theorem. We address position evaluation (i.e., predict the number of proof steps left) and tactic prediction (i.e., predict the next proof step) tasks, which arise naturally in tactic-based theorem proving.",

    "abstract": "We propose a model that learns to perform zero-shot classification using a meta-learner that is trained to produce a correction to the output of a previously trained learner. The model consists of two modules: a task module that supplies an initial prediction, and a correction module that updates the initial prediction. The task module is the learner and the correction module is the meta-learner. The correction module is trained in an episodic approach whereby many different task modules are trained on various subsets of the total training data, with the rest being used as unseen data for the correction module. The correction module takes as input a representation of the task module's training data so that the predicted correction is a function of the task module's training data.  The correction module is trained to update the task module's prediction to be closer to the target value. This approach leads to state-of-the-art performance for zero-shot classification on natural language class descriptions on the CUB and NAB datasets. ",

    "abstract": "Domain transfer is a exciting and challenging branch of machine learning because models must learn to smoothly transfer between domains, preserving local variations and capturing many aspects of variation without labels. \nHowever, most successful applications to date require the two domains to be closely related (ex. image-to-image, video-video), \nutilizing similar or shared networks to transform domain specific properties like texture, coloring, and line shapes. \nHere, we demonstrate that it is possible to transfer across modalities (ex. image-to-audio) by first abstracting the data with latent generative models and then learning transformations between latent spaces. \nWe find that a simple variational autoencoder is able to learn a shared latent space to bridge between two generative models in an unsupervised fashion, and even between different types of models (ex. variational autoencoder and a generative adversarial network). \nWe can further impose desired semantic alignment of attributes with a linear classifier in the shared latent space. \nThe proposed variation autoencoder enables preserving both locality and semantic alignment through the transfer process, as shown in the qualitative and quantitative evaluations.\nFinally, the hierarchical structure decouples the cost of training the base generative models and semantic alignments, enabling computationally efficient and data efficient retraining of personalized mapping functions.

    "abstract": "Memory-augmented neural networks consisting of a neural controller and an external memory have shown potentials in long-term sequential learning. Current RAM-like memory models maintain memory accessing every timesteps, thus they do not effectively leverage the short-term memory held in the controller. We hypothesize that this scheme of writing is suboptimal in memory utilization and introduces redundant computation. To validate our hypothesis, we derive a theoretical bound on the amount of information stored in a RAM-like system and formulate an optimization problem that maximizes the bound. The proposed solution dubbed Uniform Writing is proved to be optimal under the assumption of equal timestep contributions. To relax this assumption, we introduce modifications to the original solution, resulting in a solution termed Cached Uniform Writing. This method aims to balance between maximizing memorization and forgetting via overwriting mechanisms. Through an extensive set of experiments, we empirically demonstrate the advantages of our solutions over other recurrent architectures, claiming the state-of-the-arts in various sequential modeling tasks.

Our method is based on a graph-structured variational recurrent neural network, which is trained end-to-end to infer the current state of the (partially observed) world, as well as to forecast future states. We show that our method outperforms various baselines on two sports datasets, one based on real basketball trajectories, and one generated by a soccer game engine.",

    "title": "Neural Message Passing for Multi-Label Classification",
    "abstract": "Multi-label classification (MLC) is the task of assigning a set of target labels for a given sample. Modeling the combinatorial label interactions in MLC has been a long-haul challenge. Recurrent neural network (RNN) based encoder-decoder models have shown state-of-the-art performance for solving MLC. However, the sequential nature of modeling label dependencies through an RNN limits its ability in parallel computation, predicting dense labels, and providing interpretable results. In this paper, we propose Message Passing Encoder-Decoder (MPED) Networks,  aiming to provide fast, accurate, and interpretable MLC. MPED networks model the joint prediction of labels by replacing all RNNs in the encoder-decoder architecture with message passing mechanisms and dispense with autoregressive inference entirely.  The proposed models are simple, fast, accurate, interpretable, and structure-agnostic (can be used on known or unknown structured data). Experiments on seven real-world MLC datasets show the proposed models outperform autoregressive RNN models across five different metrics with a significant speedup during training and testing time.",

    "title": "Beyond Greedy Ranking: Slate Optimization via List-CVAE",
    "abstract": "The conventional approach to solving the recommendation problem greedily ranks\nindividual document candidates by prediction scores. However, this method fails to\noptimize the slate as a whole, and hence, often struggles to capture biases caused\nby the page layout and document interdepedencies. The slate recommendation\nproblem aims to directly find the optimally ordered subset of documents (i.e.\nslates) that best serve users’ interests. Solving this problem is hard due to the\ncombinatorial explosion of document candidates and their display positions on the\npage. Therefore we propose a paradigm shift from the traditional viewpoint of solving a ranking problem to a direct slate generation framework. In this paper, we introduce List Conditional Variational Auto-Encoders (ListCVAE),\nwhich learn the joint distribution of documents on the slate conditioned\non user responses, and directly generate full slates. Experiments on simulated\nand real-world data show that List-CVAE outperforms greedy ranking methods\nconsistently on various scales of documents corpora.",

    "abstract": "Multi-relational graph embedding which aims at achieving effective representations with reduced low-dimensional parameters, has been widely used in knowledge base completion. Although knowledge base data usually contains tree-like or cyclic structure, none of existing approaches can embed these data into a compatible space that in line with the structure. To overcome this problem, a novel framework, called Riemannian TransE, is proposed in this paper to embed the entities in a Riemannian manifold. Riemannian TransE models each relation as a move to a point and defines specific novel distance dissimilarity for each relation, so that all the relations are naturally embedded in correspondence to the structure of data. Experiments on several knowledge base completion tasks have shown that, based on an appropriate choice of manifold, Riemannian TransE achieves good performance even with a significantly reduced parameters.",

    "title": "Modeling Uncertainty with Hedged Instance Embeddings",
    "abstract": "Instance embeddings are an efficient and versatile image representation that facilitates applications like recognition, verification, retrieval, and clustering. Many metric learning methods represent the input as a single point in the embedding space. Often the distance between points is used as a proxy for match confidence. However, this can fail to represent uncertainty which can arise when the input is ambiguous, e.g., due to occlusion or blurriness. This work addresses this issue and explicitly models the uncertainty by “hedging” the location of each input in the embedding space. We introduce the hedged instance embedding (HIB) in which embeddings are modeled as random variables and the model is trained under the variational information bottleneck principle (Alemi et al., 2016; Achille & Soatto, 2018). Empirical results on our new N-digit MNIST dataset show that our method leads to the desired behavior of “hedging its bets” across the embedding space upon encountering ambiguous inputs. This results in improved performance for image matching and classification tasks, more structure in the learned embedding space, and an ability to compute a per-exemplar uncertainty measure which is correlated with downstream performance.",

    "abstract": "Modern deep neural networks have a large amount of weights, which make them difficult to deploy on computation constrained devices such as mobile phones. One common approach to reduce the model size and computational cost is to use low-rank factorization to approximate a weight matrix. However, performing standard low-rank factorization with a small rank can hurt the model expressiveness and significantly decrease the performance. In this work, we propose to use a mixture of multiple low-rank factorizations to model a large weight matrix, and the mixture coefficients are computed dynamically depending on its input. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach on both language modeling and image classification tasks. Experiments show that our method not only improves the computation efficiency but also maintains (sometimes outperforms) its accuracy compared with the full-rank counterparts.",

    "abstract": "Chemical reactions can be described as the stepwise redistribution of electrons in molecules. As such, reactions are often depicted using \"arrow-pushing\" diagrams which show this movement as a sequence of arrows. We propose an electron path prediction model (ELECTRO) to learn these sequences directly from raw reaction data. Instead of predicting product molecules directly from reactant molecules in one shot, learning a model of electron movement has the benefits of (a) being easy for chemists to interpret, (b) incorporating constraints of chemistry, such as balanced atom counts before and after the reaction, and (c) naturally encoding the sparsity of chemical reactions, which usually involve changes in only a small number of atoms in the reactants. We design a method to extract approximate reaction paths from any dataset of atom-mapped reaction SMILES strings. Our model achieves excellent performance on an important subset of the USPTO reaction dataset, comparing favorably to the strongest baselines.

    "title": "Learn From Neighbour: A Curriculum That Train Low Weighted Samples By Imitating",
    "abstract": "Deep neural networks, which gain great success in a wide spectrum of applications, are often time, compute and storage hungry. Curriculum learning proposed to boost training of network by a syllabus from easy to hard. However, the relationship between data complexity and network training is unclear: why hard example harm the performance at beginning but helps at end. In this paper, we aim to investigate on this problem. Similar to internal covariate shift in network forward pass, the distribution changes in weight of top layers also affects training of preceding layers during the backward pass. We call this phenomenon inverse \"internal covariate shift\". Training hard examples aggravates the distribution shifting and damages the training. To address this problem, we introduce a curriculum loss that consists of two parts: a) an adaptive weight that mitigates large early punishment; b) an additional representation loss for low weighted samples. The intuition of the loss is very simple. We train top layers on \"good\" samples to reduce large shifting, and encourage \"bad\" samples to learn from \"good\" sample. In detail, the adaptive weight assigns small values to hard examples, reducing the influence of noisy gradients. On the other hand, the less-weighted hard sample receives the proposed representation loss. Low-weighted data gets nearly no training signal and can stuck in embedding space for a long time. The proposed representation loss aims to encourage their training. This is done by letting them learn a better representation from its superior neighbours but not participate in learning of top layers. In this way, the fluctuation of top layers is reduced and hard samples also received signals for training. We found in this paper that curriculum learning needs random sampling between tasks for better training. Our curriculum loss is easy to combine with existing stochastic algorithms like SGD. Experimental result shows an consistent improvement over several benchmark datasets.",

    "abstract": "The impressive lifelong learning in animal brains is primarily enabled by plastic changes in synaptic connectivity. Importantly, these changes are not passive, but are actively controlled by neuromodulation, which is itself under the control of the brain. The resulting self-modifying abilities of the brain play an important role in learning and adaptation, and are a major basis for biological reinforcement learning. Here we show for the first time that artificial neural networks with such neuromodulated plasticity can be trained with gradient descent. Extending previous work on differentiable Hebbian plasticity, we propose a differentiable formulation for the neuromodulation of plasticity. We show that neuromodulated plasticity improves the performance of neural networks on both reinforcement learning and supervised learning tasks. In one task, neuromodulated plastic LSTMs with millions of parameters outperform standard LSTMs on a benchmark language modeling task (controlling for the number of parameters). We conclude that differentiable neuromodulation of plasticity offers a powerful new framework for training neural networks.",

    "abstract": "Reinforcement learning is a promising framework for solving control problems, but its use in practical situations is hampered by the fact that reward functions are often difficult to engineer. Specifying goals and tasks for autonomous machines, such as robots, is a significant challenge: conventionally, reward functions and goal states have been used to communicate objectives. But people can communicate objectives to each other simply by describing or demonstrating them. How can we build learning algorithms that will allow us to tell machines what we want them to do? In this work, we investigate the problem of grounding language commands as reward functions using inverse reinforcement learning, and argue that language-conditioned rewards are more transferable than language-conditioned policies to new environments. We propose language-conditioned reward learning (LC-RL), which grounds language commands as a reward function represented by a deep neural network. We demonstrate that our model learns rewards that transfer to novel tasks and environments on realistic, high-dimensional visual environments with natural language commands, whereas directly learning a language-conditioned policy leads to poor performance.",

In this paper, we propose a defense method, Featurized Bidirectional Generative Adversarial Networks (FBGAN), to extract the semantic features of the input and filter the non-semantic perturbation. FBGAN is pre-trained on the clean dataset in an unsupervised manner, adversarially learning a bidirectional mapping between a high-dimensional data space and a low-dimensional semantic space; also mutual information is applied to disentangle the semantically meaningful features. After the bidirectional mapping, the adversarial data can be reconstructed to denoised data, which could be fed into any pre-trained classifier. We empirically show the quality of reconstruction images and the effectiveness of defense.",

    "abstract": "Estimating the frequencies of elements in a data stream is a fundamental task in data analysis and machine learning. The problem is typically addressed using streaming algorithms which can process very large data using limited storage. Today's streaming algorithms, however, cannot exploit patterns in their input to improve performance. We propose a new class of algorithms that automatically learn relevant patterns in the input data and use them to improve its frequency estimates.   The proposed algorithms combine the benefits of machine learning with the formal guarantees available through algorithm theory.  We prove that our learning-based algorithms have lower estimation errors than their non-learning counterparts.  We also evaluate our algorithms on two real-world datasets and demonstrate empirically their performance gains.",

    "title": "Universal discriminative quantum neural networks",
    "abstract": "Quantum mechanics fundamentally forbids deterministic discrimination of quantum states and processes. However, the ability to optimally distinguish various classes of quantum data is an important primitive in quantum information science. In this work, we trained near-term quantum circuits to classify data represented by quantum states using the Adam stochastic optimization algorithm. This is achieved by iterative interactions of a classical device with a quantum processor to discover the parameters of an unknown non-unitary quantum circuit. This circuit learns to simulate the unknown structure of a generalized quantum measurement, or positive-operator valued measure (POVM), that is required to optimally distinguish possible distributions of quantum inputs. Notably we used universal circuit topologies, with a theoretically motivated circuit design which guaranteed that our circuits can perform arbitrary input-output mappings. Our numerical simulations showed that quantum circuits could be trained to discriminate among various pure and mixed quantum states, exhibiting a trade-off between minimizing erroneous and inconclusive outcomes with comparable performance to theoretically optimal POVMs. We trained the circuit on different classes of quantum data and evaluated the generalization error on unseen quantum data. This generalization power hence distinguishes our work from standard circuit optimization and provides an example of quantum machine learning for a task that has inherently no classical analogue. ",

    "title": "Consistency-based anomaly detection with adaptive multiple-hypotheses predictions",
    "abstract": "In one-class-learning tasks, only the normal case can be modeled with data, whereas the variation of all possible anomalies is too large to be described sufficiently by samples. Thus, due to the lack of representative data, the wide-spread discriminative approaches cannot cover such learning tasks, and rather generative models, which attempt to learn the input density of the normal cases, are used. However, generative models suffer from a large input dimensionality (as in images) and are typically inefficient learners. We propose to learn the data distribution more efficiently with a multi-hypotheses autoencoder. Moreover, the model is criticized by a discriminator, which prevents artificial data modes not supported by data, and which enforces diversity across hypotheses. This consistency-based anomaly detection (ConAD) framework allows the reliable identification of outof- distribution samples. For anomaly detection on CIFAR-10, it yields up to 3.9% points improvement over previously reported results. On a real anomaly detection task, the approach reduces the error of the baseline models from 6.8% to 1.5%.",

    "abstract": "Generative adversarial networks (GANs) form a generative modeling approach known for producing appealing samples, but they are notably difficult to train. One common way to tackle this issue has been to propose new formulations of the GAN objective. Yet, surprisingly few studies have looked at optimization methods designed for this adversarial training. In this work, we cast GAN optimization problems in the general variational inequality framework. Tapping into the mathematical programming literature, we counter some common misconceptions about the difficulties of saddle point optimization and propose to extend methods designed for variational inequalities to the training of GANs. We apply averaging, extrapolation and a computationally cheaper variant that we call extrapolation from the past to the stochastic gradient method (SGD) and Adam.",

    "title": "Enabling Factorized Piano Music Modeling and Generation with the MAESTRO Dataset",
    "abstract": "Generating musical audio directly with neural networks is notoriously difficult because it requires coherently modeling structure at many different timescales. Fortunately, most music is also highly structured and can be represented as discrete note events played on musical instruments. Herein, we show that by using notes as an intermediate representation, we can train a suite of models capable of transcribing, composing, and synthesizing audio waveforms with coherent musical structure on timescales spanning six orders of magnitude (~0.1 ms to ~100 s), a process we call Wave2Midi2Wave. This large advance in the state of the art is enabled by our release of the new MAESTRO (MIDI and Audio Edited for Synchronous TRacks and Organization) dataset, composed of over 172 hours of virtuosic piano performances captured with fine alignment (~3 ms) between note labels and audio waveforms. The networks and the dataset together present a promising approach toward creating new expressive and interpretable neural models of music.",

    "title": "Are adversarial examples inevitable?",
    "abstract": "A wide range of defenses have been proposed to harden neural networks against adversarial attacks. However, a pattern has emerged in which the majority of adversarial defenses are quickly broken by new attacks.  Given the lack of success at generating robust defenses, we are led to ask a fundamental question:  Are adversarial attacks inevitable?\nThis paper analyzes adversarial examples from a theoretical perspective, and identifies fundamental bounds on the susceptibility of a classifier to adversarial attacks.   We show that, for certain classes of problems, adversarial examples are inescapable.  Using experiments, we explore the implications of theoretical guarantees for real-world problems and discuss how factors such as dimensionality and image complexity limit a classifier's robustness against adversarial examples.\n\n",

    "title": "Assumption Questioning: Latent Copying and Reward Exploitation in Question Generation",
    "abstract": "Question generation is an important task for improving our ability to process natural language data, with additional challenges over other sequence transformation tasks. Recent approaches use modifications to a Seq2Seq architecture inspired by advances in machine translation, but unlike translation the input and output vocabularies overlap significantly, and there are many different valid questions for each input. Approaches using copy mechanisms and reinforcement learning have shown promising results, but there are ambiguities in the exact implementation that have not yet been investigated. We show that by removing inductive bias from the model and allowing the choice of generation path to become latent, we achieve substantial improvements over implementations biased with both naive and smart heuristics. We perform a human evaluation to confirm these findings. We show that although policy gradient methods may be used to decouple training from the ground truth and optimise directly for quality metrics that have previously been assumed to be good choices, these objectives are poorly aligned with human judgement and the model simply learns to exploit the weaknesses of the reward source. Finally, we show that an adversarial objective learned directly from the ground truth data is not able to generate a useful training signal.",

    "abstract": "Probabilistic models are often trained by maximum likelihood, which corresponds to minimizing a specific form of f-divergence between the model and data distribution. We derive an upper bound that holds for all f-divergences, showing the intuitive result that the divergence between two joint distributions is at least as great as the divergence between their corresponding marginals. Additionally, the f-divergence is not formally defined when two distributions have different supports. We thus propose a noisy version of f-divergence which is well defined in such situations. We demonstrate how the bound and the new version of f-divergence can be readily used to train complex probabilistic generative models of data and that the fitted model can depend significantly on the particular divergence used.",

    "abstract": "When a bilingual student learns to solve word problems in math, we expect the student to be able to solve these problem in both languages the student is fluent in, even if the math lessons were only taught in one language. However, current representations in machine learning are language dependent. In this work, we present a method to decouple the language from the problem by learning language agnostic representations and therefore allowing training a model in one language and applying to a different one in a zero shot fashion. We learn these representations by taking inspiration from linguistics, specifically the Universal Grammar hypothesis and learn universal latent representations that are language agnostic (Chomsky, 2014; Montague, 1970). We demonstrate the capabilities of these representations by showing that the models trained on a single language using language agnostic representations achieve very similar accuracies in other languages.",

    "abstract": "In open-domain dialogue intelligent agents should exhibit the use of knowledge, however there are few convincing demonstrations of this to date. The most popular sequence to sequence models typically “generate and hope” generic utterances that can be memorized in the weights of the model when mapping from input utterance(s) to output, rather than employing recalled knowledge as context. Use of knowledge has so far proved difficult, in part because of the lack of a supervised learning benchmark task which exhibits knowledgeable open dialogue with clear  grounding. To that end we collect and release a large dataset with conversations directly grounded with knowledge retrieved from Wikipedia.  We then design architectures capable of retrieving knowledge, reading and conditioning on it, and finally generating natural responses. Our best performing dialogue models are able to conduct knowledgeable discussions on open-domain topics as evaluated by automatic metrics and human evaluations, while our new benchmark allows for measuring further improvements in this important research direction.",

We prove generalization by first establishing a stronger convergence result, along with a rate of convergence.   A second result resolves a question posed in Zhang et al. (2016): how can a model distinguish between the case of clean labels, and randomized labels?  Our answer is that Lipschitz regularization using the Lipschitz constant of the clean data makes this distinction.  In this case, the model learns a different function which we hypothesize correctly fails to learn the dirty labels.  ",

Our model uses advances in variational autoencoders (VAEs) for sequential data and combines it with recent work on neural image compression. The approach jointly learns to transform the original video into a  lower-dimensional representation as well as to entropy code this representation according to a temporally-conditioned probabilistic model. We split the latent space into local (per frame) and global (per segment) variables, and show that training the VAE to utilize both representations leads to an improved rate-distortion performance. Evaluation on small videos from public data sets with varying complexity and diversity show that our model yields competitive results when trained on generic video content. Extreme compression performance is achieved for videos with specialized content if the model is trained on similar videos.",

    "title": "Pearl: Prototype lEArning via Rule Lists",
    "abstract": "Deep neural networks have demonstrated promising prediction and classification performance on many healthcare applications. However, the interpretability of those models are often lacking. On the other hand, classical interpretable models such as rule lists or decision trees do not lead to the same level of accuracy as deep neural networks and can often be too complex to interpret (due to the potentially large depth of rule lists). In this work, we present PEARL,  Prototype lEArning via Rule Lists, which iteratively uses rule lists to guide a neural network to learn representative data prototypes. The resulting prototype neural network provides  accurate prediction, and the prediction can be easily explained by  prototype and its guiding rule lists. Thanks to the prediction power of neural networks, the rule lists from\t\t\t\t prototypes are more concise and hence provide better interpretability. On two real-world electronic healthcare records (EHR) datasets, PEARL consistently outperforms all baselines across both datasets, especially achieving performance improvement over conventional rule learning by up to 28% and over prototype learning by up to 3%. Experimental results also show the resulting interpretation of PEARL is  simpler than the standard rule learning.",

    "title": "Distinguishability of Adversarial Examples",
    "abstract": "Machine learning models including traditional models and neural networks can be easily fooled by adversarial examples which are generated from the natural examples with small perturbations.  This poses a critical challenge to machine learning security, and impedes the wide application of machine learning in many important domains such as computer vision and malware detection.  Unfortunately, even state-of-the-art defense approaches such as adversarial training and defensive distillation still suffer from major limitations and can be circumvented.  From a unique angle, we propose to investigate two important research questions in this paper: Are adversarial examples distinguishable from natural examples?  Are adversarial examples generated by different methods distinguishable from each other?  These two questions concern the distinguishability of adversarial examples.  Answering them will potentially lead to a simple yet effective approach, termed as defensive distinction in this paper under the formulation of multi-label classification, for protecting against adversarial examples.  We design and perform experiments using the MNIST dataset to investigate these two questions, and obtain highly positive results demonstrating the strong distinguishability of adversarial examples.  We recommend that this unique defensive distinction approach should be seriously considered to complement other defense approaches.",

We propose to use the cosine similarity between gradients of tasks as an adaptive weight to detect when an auxiliary loss is helpful to the main loss. We show that our approach is guaranteed to converge to critical points of the main task and demonstrate the practical usefulness of the proposed algorithm in a few domains: multi-task supervised learning on subsets of ImageNet, reinforcement learning on gridworld, and reinforcement learning on Atari games.",

    "abstract": "Generating coherent and cohesive long-form texts is a challenging problem in natural language generation. Previous works relied on a large amount of human-generated texts to train neural language models, however, few attempted to explicitly model the desired linguistic properties of natural language text, such as coherence and cohesion using neural networks. In this work, we train two expert discriminators for coherence and cohesion to provide hierarchical feedback for text generation. We also propose a simple variant of policy gradient, called 'negative-critical sequence training' in which the reward 'baseline' is constructed from randomly generated negative samples. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through empirical studies, showing improvements over the strong baseline -- attention-based bidirectional MLE-trained neural language model -- in a number of automated metrics. The proposed model can serve as baseline architectures to promote further research in modeling additional linguistic properties for downstream NLP tasks.",

    "abstract": "Accurate rent prediction in real estate investment can help in generating capital gains and guaranty a financial success. In this paper, we carry out a comprehensive analysis and study of eleven machine learning algorithms for rent prediction, including Linear Regression, Multilayer Perceptron, Random Forest, KNN, ML-KNN, Locally Weighted Learning, SMO, SVM, J48, lazy Decision Tree (i.e., lazy DT), and KStar algorithms. \nOur contribution in this paper is twofold: (1) We present a comprehensive analysis of internal and external attributes of a real-estate housing dataset and their correlation with rental prices. (2) We use rental prediction as a platform to study and compare the performance of eager vs. lazy machine learning methods using myriad of ML algorithms.  \nWe train our rent prediction models using a Zillow data set of 4K real estate properties in Virginia State of the US, including three house types of single-family, townhouse, and condo. Each data instance in the dataset has 21 internal attributes (e.g., area space, price, number of bed/bath, rent, school rating, so forth). In addition to Zillow data, external attributes like walk/transit score, and crime rate are collected from online data sources. A subset of the collected features - determined by the PCA technique-  are selected to tune the parameters of the prediction models. We employ a hierarchical clustering approach to cluster the data based on two factors of house type, and average rent estimate of zip codes. We evaluate and compare the efficacy of the tuned prediction models based on two metrics of R-squared and Mean Absolute Error, applied on unseen data. Based on our study, lazy models like KStar lead to higher accuracy and lower prediction error compared to eager methods like J48 and LR. However, it is not necessarily found to be an overarching conclusion drawn from the comparison between all the lazy and eager methods in this work. ",

Current approaches attempt to learn the transformation from a noise sample to a generated data sample in one shot. Our proposed generator architecture, called ChainGAN, uses a two-step process. It first attempts to transform a noise vector into a crude sample, similar to a traditional generator. Next, a chain of networks, called editors, attempt to sequentially enhance this sample. We train each of these units independently, instead of with end-to-end backpropagation on the entire chain. Our model is robust, efficient, and flexible as we can apply it to various network architectures. We provide rationale for our choices and experimentally evaluate our model, achieving competitive results on several datasets.",

    "title": "Jumpout: Improved Dropout for Deep Neural Networks with Rectified Linear Units",
    "abstract": "Dropout is a simple yet effective technique to improve generalization performance and prevent overfitting in deep neural networks (DNNs). In this paper, we discuss three novel observations about dropout to better understand the generalization of DNNs with rectified linear unit (ReLU) activations: 1) dropout is a smoothing technique that encourages each local linear model of a DNN to be trained on data points from nearby regions; 2) a constant dropout rate can result in effective neural-deactivation rates that are significantly different for layers with different fractions of activated neurons; and 3) the rescaling factor of dropout causes an inconsistency to occur between the normalization during training and testing conditions when batch normalization is also used.  The above leads to three simple but nontrivial improvements to dropout resulting in our proposed method \"Jumpout.\" Jumpout samples the dropout rate using a monotone decreasing distribution (such as the right part of a truncated Gaussian), so the local linear model at each data point is trained, with high probability, to work better for data points from nearby than from more distant regions. Instead of tuning a dropout rate for each layer and applying it to all samples, jumpout moreover adaptively normalizes the dropout rate at each layer and every training sample/batch, so the effective dropout rate applied to the activated neurons are kept the same. Moreover, we rescale the outputs of jumpout for a better trade-off that keeps both the variance and mean of neurons more consistent between training and test phases, which mitigates the incompatibility between dropout and batch normalization. Compared to the original dropout, jumpout shows significantly improved performance on CIFAR10, CIFAR100, Fashion- MNIST, STL10, SVHN, ImageNet-1k, etc., while introducing negligible additional memory and computation costs.",

    "abstract": "Neural networks are known to be a class of highly expressive functions able to fit even random input-output mappings with 100% accuracy. In this work we present properties of neural networks that complement this aspect of expressivity. By using tools from Fourier analysis, we show that deep ReLU networks are biased towards low frequency functions, meaning that they cannot have local fluctuations without affecting their global behavior. Intuitively, this property is in line with the observation that over-parameterized networks find simple patterns that generalize across data samples. We also investigate how the shape of the data manifold affects expressivity by showing evidence that learning high frequencies gets easier with increasing manifold complexity, and present a theoretical understanding of this behavior. Finally, we study the robustness of the frequency components with respect to parameter perturbation, to develop the intuition that the parameters must be finely tuned to express high frequency functions.",

    "title": "Reconciling Feature-Reuse and Overfitting in DenseNet with Specialized Dropout",
    "abstract": "Recently convolutional neural networks (CNNs) achieve great accuracy in visual recognition tasks. DenseNet becomes one of the most popular CNN models due to its effectiveness in feature-reuse. However, like other CNN models, DenseNets also face overfitting problem if not severer. Existing dropout method can be applied but not as effective due to the introduced nonlinear connections. In particular, the property of feature-reuse in DenseNet will be impeded, and the dropout effect will be weakened by the spatial correlation inside feature maps. To address these problems, we craft the design of a specialized dropout method from three aspects, dropout location, dropout granularity, and dropout probability. The insights attained here could potentially be applied as a general approach for boosting the accuracy of other CNN models with similar nonlinear connections. Experimental results show that DenseNets with our specialized dropout method yield better accuracy compared to vanilla DenseNet and state-of-the-art CNN models, and such accuracy boost increases with the model depth.",

    "abstract": "Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) are very successful at solving challenging problems with sequential data. However, this observed efficiency is not yet entirely explained by theory. It is known that a certain class of multiplicative RNNs enjoys the property of depth efficiency --- a shallow network of exponentially large width is necessary to realize the same score function as computed by such an RNN. Such networks, however, are not very often applied to real life tasks. In this work, we attempt to reduce the gap between theory and practice by extending the theoretical analysis to RNNs which employ various nonlinearities, such as Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU), and show that they also benefit from properties of universality and depth efficiency. Our theoretical results are verified by a series of extensive computational experiments.",

    "abstract": "This report introduces a training and recognition scheme, in which classification is realized via class-wise discerning. Trained with datasets whose labels are randomly shuffled except for one class of interest, a neural network learns class-wise parameter values, and remolds itself from a feature sorter into feature filters, each of which discerns objects belonging to one of the classes only. Classification of an input can be inferred from the maximum response of the filters. A multiple check with multiple versions of filters can diminish fluctuation and yields better performance. This scheme of discerning, maximum response and multiple check is a method of general viability to improve performance of feedforward networks, and the filter training itself is a promising feature abstraction procedure. In contrast to the direct sorting, the scheme mimics the classification process mediated by a series of one component picking.",

    "title": "Hint-based Training for Non-Autoregressive Translation",
    "abstract": "Machine translation is an important real-world application, and neural network-based AutoRegressive Translation (ART) models have achieved very promising accuracy. Due to the unparallelizable nature of the autoregressive factorization, ART models have to generate tokens one by one during decoding and thus suffer from high inference latency. Recently, Non-AutoRegressive Translation (NART) models were proposed to reduce the inference time. However, they could only achieve inferior accuracy compared with ART models. To improve the accuracy of NART models, in this paper, we propose to leverage the hints from a well-trained ART model to train the NART model. We define two hints for the machine translation task: hints from hidden states and hints from word alignments, and use such hints to regularize the optimization of NART models. Experimental results show that the NART model trained with hints could achieve significantly better translation performance than previous NART models on several tasks. In particular, for the WMT14 En-De and De-En task, we obtain BLEU scores of 25.20 and 29.52 respectively, which largely outperforms the previous non-autoregressive baselines. It is even comparable to a strong LSTM-based ART model (24.60 on WMT14 En-De), but one order of magnitude faster in inference.",

    "title": "Equi-normalization of Neural Networks",
    "abstract": "Modern neural networks are over-parametrized. In particular, each rectified linear hidden unit can be modified by a multiplicative factor by adjusting input and out- put weights, without changing the rest of the network. Inspired by the Sinkhorn-Knopp algorithm, we introduce a fast iterative method for minimizing the l2 norm of the weights, equivalently the weight decay regularizer. It provably converges to a unique solution. Interleaving our algorithm with SGD during training improves the test accuracy. For small batches, our approach offers an alternative to batch- and group- normalization on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet with a ResNet-18.",

    "title": "Label Propagation Networks",
    "abstract": "Graph networks have recently attracted considerable interest, and in particular in the context of semi-supervised learning. These methods typically work by generating node representations that are propagated throughout a given weighted graph.\n\nHere we argue that for semi-supervised learning, it is more natural to consider propagating labels in the graph instead. Towards this end, we propose a differentiable neural version of the classic Label Propagation (LP) algorithm. This formulation can be used for learning edge weights, unlike other methods where weights are set heuristically. Starting from a layer implementing a single iteration of LP, we proceed by adding several important non-linear steps that significantly enhance the label-propagating mechanism.\n\nExperiments in two distinct settings demonstrate the utility of our approach.\n",

    "title": "MLPrune: Multi-Layer Pruning for Automated Neural Network Compression",
    "abstract": "Model compression can significantly reduce the computation and memory footprint of large neural networks. To achieve a good trade-off between model size and accuracy, popular compression techniques usually rely on hand-crafted heuristics and\nrequire manually setting the compression ratio of each layer. This process is typically costly and suboptimal. In this paper, we propose a Multi-Layer Pruning method (MLPrune), which is theoretically sound, and can automatically decide appropriate compression ratios for all layers. Towards this goal, we use an efficient approximation of the Hessian as our pruning criterion, based on a Kronecker-factored Approximate Curvature method. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on several datasets and architectures, outperforming previous state-of-the-art by a large margin. Our experiments show that we can compress AlexNet and VGG16 by 25x without loss in accuracy on ImageNet. Furthermore, our method has much fewer hyper-parameters and requires no expert knowledge.",

    "title": "Characterizing Audio Adversarial Examples Using Temporal Dependency",
    "abstract": "Recent studies have highlighted adversarial examples as a ubiquitous threat to different neural network models and many downstream  applications. Nonetheless, as unique data properties have inspired distinct and powerful learning principles, this paper aims to explore their potentials towards mitigating adversarial inputs. In particular, our results reveal the importance of using the temporal dependency in audio data to gain discriminate power against adversarial examples. Tested on the automatic speech recognition (ASR) tasks and three recent audio adversarial attacks, we find that (i) input transformation developed from image adversarial defense provides limited robustness improvement and is subtle to advanced attacks; (ii) temporal dependency can be exploited to gain discriminative power against audio adversarial examples and is resistant to adaptive attacks considered in our experiments. Our results not only show promising means of improving the robustness of ASR systems, but also offer novel insights in exploiting domain-specific data properties to mitigate negative effects of adversarial examples.",

    "abstract": "Massively multi-label prediction/classification problems arise in environments like health-care or biology where it is useful to make very precise predictions. One challenge with massively multi-label problems is that there is often a long-tailed frequency distribution for the labels, resulting in few positive examples for the rare labels. We propose a solution to this problem by modifying the output layer of a neural network to create a Bayesian network of sigmoids which takes advantage of ontology relationships between the labels to help share information between the rare and the more common labels.  We apply this method to the two massively multi-label tasks of disease prediction (ICD-9 codes) and protein function prediction (Gene Ontology terms) and obtain significant improvements in per-label AUROC and average precision.",

    "abstract": "To gain high rewards in muti-agent scenes, it is sometimes necessary to understand other agents and make corresponding optimal decisions. We can solve these tasks by first building models for other agents and then finding the optimal policy with these models. To get an accurate model, many observations are needed and this can be sample-inefficient. What's more, the learned model and policy can overfit to current agents and cannot generalize if the other agents are replaced by new agents. In many practical situations, each agent we face can be considered as a sample from a population with a fixed but unknown distribution. Thus we can treat the task against some specific agents as a task sampled from a task distribution. We apply meta-learning method to build models and learn policies. Therefore when new agents come, we can adapt to them efficiently. Experiments on grid games show that our method can quickly get high rewards.",

    "abstract": "Deep neural networks have achieved outstanding performance in many real-world applications with the expense of huge computational resources. The DenseNet, one of the recently proposed neural network architecture, has achieved the state-of-the-art performance in many visual tasks. However, it has great redundancy due to the dense connections of the internal structure, which leads to high computational costs in training such dense networks. To address this issue,  we design a reinforcement learning framework to search for efficient DenseNet architectures with layer-wise pruning (LWP) for different tasks, while retaining the original advantages of DenseNet, such as feature reuse, short paths, etc. In this framework, an agent evaluates the importance of each connection between any two block layers, and prunes the redundant connections. In addition, a novel reward-shaping trick is introduced to make DenseNet reach a better trade-off between accuracy and float point operations (FLOPs). Our experiments show that DenseNet with LWP is more compact and efficient than existing alternatives.  ",

    "abstract": "Semantic parsing which maps a natural language sentence into a formal machine-readable representation of its meaning, is highly constrained by the limited annotated training data. Inspired by the idea of coarse-to-fine, we propose a general-to-detailed neural network(GDNN) by incorporating cross-domain sketch(CDS) among utterances and their logic forms. For utterances in different domains, the General Network will extract CDS using an encoder-decoder model in a multi-task learning setup. Then for some utterances in a specific domain, the Detailed Network will generate the detailed target parts using sequence-to-sequence architecture with advanced attention to both utterance and generated CDS. Our experiments show that compared to direct multi-task learning, CDS has improved the performance in semantic parsing task which converts users' requests into meaning representation language(MRL). We also use experiments to illustrate that CDS works by adding some constraints to the target decoding process, which further proves the effectiveness and rationality of CDS.",

    "abstract": "We identify a phenomenon, which we refer to as *multi-model forgetting*, that occurs when sequentially training multiple deep networks with partially-shared parameters; the performance of previously-trained models degrades as one optimizes a subsequent one, due to the overwriting of shared parameters. To overcome this, we introduce a statistically-justified weight plasticity loss that regularizes the learning of a model's shared parameters according to their importance for the previous models, and demonstrate its effectiveness when training two models sequentially and for neural architecture search. Adding weight plasticity in neural architecture search preserves the best models to the end of the search and yields improved results in both natural language processing and computer vision tasks.",

    "title": "GRAPH TRANSFORMATION POLICY NETWORK FOR CHEMICAL REACTION PREDICTION",
    "abstract": "We address a fundamental problem in chemistry known as chemical reaction product prediction. Our main insight is that the input reactant and reagent molecules can be jointly represented as a graph, and the process of generating product molecules from reactant molecules can be formulated as a sequence of graph transformations. To this end, we propose Graph Transformation Policy Network (GTPN) - a novel generic method that combines the strengths of graph neural networks and reinforcement learning to learn the reactions directly from data with minimal chemical knowledge. Compared to previous methods, GTPN has some appealing properties such as: end-to-end learning, and making no assumption about the length or the order of graph transformations. In order to guide model search through the complex discrete space of sets of bond changes effectively, we extend the standard policy gradient loss by adding useful constraints. Evaluation results show that GTPN improves the top-1 accuracy over the current state-of-the-art method by about 3% on the large USPTO dataset. Our model's performances and prediction errors are also analyzed carefully in the paper.",

    "title": "Minimal Random Code Learning: Getting Bits Back from Compressed Model Parameters",
    "abstract": "While deep neural networks are a highly successful model class, their large memory footprint puts considerable strain on energy consumption, communication bandwidth, and storage requirements. Consequently, model size reduction has become an utmost goal in deep learning. A typical approach is to train a set of deterministic weights, while applying certain techniques such as pruning and quantization, in order that the empirical weight distribution becomes amenable to Shannon-style coding schemes. However, as shown in this paper, relaxing weight determinism and using a full variational distribution over weights allows for more efficient coding schemes and consequently higher compression rates. In particular, following the classical bits-back argument, we encode the network weights using a random sample, requiring only a number of bits corresponding to the Kullback-Leibler divergence between the sampled variational distribution and the encoding distribution. By imposing a constraint on the Kullback-Leibler divergence, we are able to explicitly control the compression rate, while optimizing the expected loss on the training set. The employed encoding scheme can be shown to be close to the optimal information-theoretical lower bound, with respect to the employed variational family. Our method sets new state-of-the-art in neural network compression, as it strictly dominates previous approaches in a Pareto sense: On the benchmarks LeNet-5/MNIST and VGG-16/CIFAR-10, our approach yields the best test performance for a fixed memory budget, and vice versa, it achieves the highest compression rates for a fixed test performance.",

    "title": "DEEP-TRIM: REVISITING L1 REGULARIZATION FOR CONNECTION PRUNING OF DEEP NETWORK",
    "abstract": "State-of-the-art deep neural networks (DNNs) typically have tens of millions of parameters, which might not fit into the upper levels of the memory hierarchy, thus increasing the inference time and energy consumption significantly, and prohibiting their use on edge devices such as mobile phones. The compression of DNN models has therefore become an active area of research recently, with \\emph{connection pruning} emerging as one of the most successful strategies. A very natural approach is to prune connections of DNNs via $\\ell_1$ regularization, but recent empirical investigations have suggested that this does not work as well in the context of DNN compression. In this work, we revisit this simple strategy and analyze it rigorously, to show that: (a) any \\emph{stationary point} of an $\\ell_1$-regularized layerwise-pruning objective has its number of non-zero elements bounded by the number of penalized prediction logits, regardless of the strength of the regularization; (b) successful pruning highly relies on an accurate optimization solver, and there is a trade-off between compression speed and distortion of prediction accuracy, controlled by the strength of regularization. Our theoretical results thus suggest that $\\ell_1$ pruning could be successful provided we use an accurate optimization solver. We corroborate this in our experiments, where we show that simple $\\ell_1$ regularization with an Adamax-L1(cumulative) solver gives pruning ratio competitive to the state-of-the-art.",

    "title": "Towards More Theoretically-Grounded Particle Optimization Sampling for Deep Learning",
    "abstract": "Many deep-learning based methods such as Bayesian deep learning (DL) and deep reinforcement learning (RL) have heavily relied on the ability of a model being able to efficiently explore via Bayesian sampling. Particle-optimization sampling (POS) is a recently developed technique to generate high-quality samples from a target distribution by iteratively updating a set of interactive particles, with a representative algorithm the Stein variational gradient descent (SVGD). Though obtaining significant empirical success, the {\\em non-asymptotic} convergence behavior of SVGD remains unknown. In this paper, we generalize POS to a stochasticity setting by injecting random noise in particle updates, called stochastic particle-optimization sampling (SPOS). Notably, for the first time, we develop {\\em non-asymptotic convergence theory} for the SPOS framework, characterizing convergence of a sample approximation w.r.t.\\! the number of particles and iterations under both convex- and noncovex-energy-function settings. Interestingly, we provide theoretical understanding of a pitfall of SVGD that can be avoided in the proposed SPOS framework, {\\it i.e.}, particles tend to collapse to a local mode in SVGD under some particular conditions. Our theory is based on the analysis of nonlinear stochastic differential equations, which serves as an extension and a complementary development to the asymptotic convergence theory for SVGD such as (Liu, 2017). With such theoretical guarantees, SPOS can be safely and effectively applied on both Bayesian DL and deep RL tasks. Extensive results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed framework.",

    "abstract": "Revealing latent structure in data is an active field of research, having introduced exciting technologies such as variational autoencoders and adversarial networks, and is essential to push machine learning towards unsupervised knowledge discovery. However, a major challenge is the lack of suitable benchmarks for an objective and quantitative evaluation of learned representations. To address this issue we introduce Morpho-MNIST, a framework that aims to answer: \"to what extent has my model learned to represent specific factors of variation in the data?\" We extend the popular MNIST dataset by adding a morphometric analysis enabling quantitative comparison of trained models, identification of the roles of latent variables, and characterisation of sample diversity. We further propose a set of quantifiable perturbations to assess the performance of unsupervised and supervised methods on challenging tasks such as outlier detection and domain adaptation.",

    "title": "LSH Microbatches for Stochastic Gradients:  Value in Rearrangement",
    "abstract": "   Metric embeddings are   immensely useful representations of associations between entities   (images, users, search queries, words, and more).  Embeddings are learned by  optimizing a loss objective of the general form of a sum over example associations. Typically, the optimization uses stochastic gradient updates over minibatches of examples that are arranged  independently at random. In this work, we propose the use of {\\em structured arrangements} through randomized {\\em microbatches} of examples that are more likely to include similar ones. We make a principled argument for the properties of our arrangements  that accelerate the training and present efficient algorithms to generate microbatches that respect the marginal  distribution of training examples.  Finally, we observe experimentally that our structured arrangements accelerate training by 3-20\\%. Structured arrangements emerge as a powerful and novel performance knob for SGD that is independent and complementary to other SGD  hyperparameters and thus is a candidate for wide deployment.",

    "abstract": "Several first order stochastic optimization methods commonly used in the Euclidean domain such as stochastic gradient descent (SGD), accelerated gradient descent or variance reduced methods have already been adapted to certain Riemannian settings. However, some of the most popular of these optimization tools - namely Adam, Adagrad and the more recent Amsgrad - remain to be generalized to Riemannian manifolds. We discuss the difficulty of generalizing such adaptive schemes to the most agnostic Riemannian setting, and then provide algorithms and convergence proofs for geodesically convex objectives in the particular case of a product of Riemannian manifolds, in which adaptivity is implemented across manifolds in the cartesian product. Our generalization is tight in the sense that choosing the Euclidean space as Riemannian manifold yields the same algorithms and regret bounds as those that were already known for the standard algorithms. Experimentally, we show faster convergence and to a lower train loss value for Riemannian adaptive methods over their corresponding baselines on the realistic task of embedding the WordNet taxonomy in the Poincare ball.",

The architecture is based on the use of a semi-parametric interpolation network followed by the application of a prediction network. The interpolation network allows for information to be shared across multiple dimensions of a multivariate time series during the interpolation stage, while any standard deep learning model can be used for the prediction network. This work is motivated by the analysis of physiological time series data in electronic health records, which are sparse, irregularly sampled, and multivariate. We investigate the performance of this architecture on both classification and regression tasks, showing that our approach outperforms a range of baseline and recently proposed models.\n",

We present an unsupervised learning algorithm to train agents to achieve perceptually-specified goals using only a stream of observations and actions. Our agent simultaneously learns a goal-conditioned policy and a goal achievement reward function that measures how similar a state is to the goal state. This dual optimization leads to a co-operative game, giving rise to a learned reward function that reflects similarity in controllable aspects of the environment instead of distance in the space of observations. We demonstrate the efficacy of our agent to learn, in an unsupervised manner, to reach a diverse set of goals on three domains -- Atari, the DeepMind Control Suite and DeepMind Lab.",

    "abstract": "Recurrent neural networks can be difficult to train on long sequence data due to the well-known vanishing gradient problem. Some architectures incorporate methods to reduce RNN state updates, therefore allowing the network to preserve memory over long temporal intervals. To address these problems of convergence, this paper proposes a timing-gated LSTM RNN model, called the Gaussian-gated LSTM (g-LSTM). The time gate controls when a neuron can be updated during training, enabling longer memory persistence and better error-gradient flow. This model captures long-temporal dependencies better than an LSTM and the time gate parameters can be learned even from non-optimal initialization values. Because the time gate limits the updates of the neuron state, the number of computes needed for the network update is also reduced. By adding a computational budget term to the training loss, we can obtain a network which further reduces the number of computes by at least 10x. Finally, by employing a temporal curriculum learning schedule for the g-LSTM, we can reduce the convergence time of the equivalent LSTM network on long sequences.",

    "title": "TabNN: A Universal Neural Network Solution for Tabular Data",
    "abstract": "Neural Network (NN) has achieved state-of-the-art performances in many tasks within image, speech, and text domains. Such great success is mainly due to special structure design to fit the particular data patterns, such as CNN capturing spatial locality and RNN modeling sequential dependency. Essentially, these specific NNs achieve good performance by leveraging the prior knowledge over corresponding domain data. Nevertheless, there are many applications with all kinds of tabular data in other domains. Since there are no shared patterns among these diverse tabular data, it is hard to design specific structures to fit them all. Without careful architecture design based on domain knowledge, it is quite challenging for NN to reach satisfactory performance in these tabular data domains. To fill the gap of NN in tabular data learning, we propose a universal neural network solution, called TabNN, to derive effective NN architectures for tabular data in all kinds of tasks automatically. Specifically, the design of TabNN follows two principles: \\emph{to explicitly leverages expressive feature combinations} and \\emph{to reduce model complexity}. Since GBDT has empirically proven its strength in modeling tabular data, we use GBDT to power the implementation of TabNN. Comprehensive experimental analysis on a variety of tabular datasets demonstrate that TabNN can achieve much better performance than many baseline solutions.",

    "title": "Self-Tuning Networks: Bilevel Optimization of Hyperparameters using Structured Best-Response Functions",
    "abstract": "Hyperparameter optimization can be formulated as a bilevel optimization problem, where the optimal parameters on the training set depend on the hyperparameters. We aim to adapt regularization hyperparameters for neural networks by fitting compact approximations to the best-response function, which maps hyperparameters to optimal weights and biases. We show how to construct scalable best-response approximations for neural networks by modeling the best-response as a single network whose hidden units are gated conditionally on the regularizer. We justify this approximation by showing the exact best-response for a shallow linear network with L2-regularized Jacobian can be represented by a similar gating mechanism. We fit this model using a gradient-based hyperparameter optimization algorithm which alternates between approximating the best-response around the current hyperparameters and optimizing the hyperparameters using the approximate best-response function. Unlike other gradient-based approaches, we do not require differentiating the training loss with respect to the hyperparameters, allowing us to tune discrete hyperparameters, data augmentation hyperparameters, and dropout probabilities. Because the hyperparameters are adapted online, our approach discovers hyperparameter schedules that can outperform fixed hyperparameter values. Empirically, our approach outperforms competing hyperparameter optimization methods on large-scale deep learning problems. We call our networks, which update their own hyperparameters online during training, Self-Tuning Networks (STNs).",

    "title": "Neural network gradient-based learning of black-box function interfaces",
    "abstract": "Deep neural networks work well at approximating complicated functions when provided with data and trained by gradient descent methods. At the same time, there is a vast amount of existing functions that programmatically solve different tasks in a precise manner eliminating the need for training. In many cases, it is possible to decompose a task to a series of functions, of which for some we may prefer to use a neural network to learn the functionality, while for others the preferred method would be to use existing black-box functions. We propose a method for end-to-end training of a base neural network that integrates calls to existing black-box functions. We do so by approximating the black-box functionality with a differentiable neural network in a way that drives the base network to comply with the black-box function interface during the end-to-end optimization process. At inference time, we replace the differentiable estimator with its external black-box non-differentiable counterpart such that the base network output matches the input arguments of the black-box function. Using this ``Estimate and Replace'' paradigm, we train a neural network, end to end, to compute the input to black-box functionality while eliminating the need for intermediate labels. We show that by leveraging the existing precise black-box function during inference, the integrated model generalizes better than a fully differentiable model, and learns more efficiently compared to RL-based methods.",

    "abstract": "Recently, generative adversarial network is the hotspot in research areas and industrial application areas. It's application on data generation in computer vision is most common usage. This paper extends its application to data hiding and security area. In this paper, we propose the novel framework to integrate steganography and steganalysis processes. The proposed framework applies generative adversarial networks as the core structure. The discriminative model simulate the steganalysis process, which can help us understand the sensitivity of cover images to semantic changes. The steganography generative model is to generate stego image which is aligned with the original cover image, and attempts to confuse steganalysis discriminative model. The introduction of cycle discriminative model and inconsistent loss can help to enhance the quality and security of generated stego image in the iterative training process. Training dataset is mixed with intact images as well as intentional attacked images. The mix training process can further improve the robustness and security of new framework. Through the qualitative, quantitative experiments and analysis, this novel framework shows compelling performance and advantages over the current state-of-the-art methods in steganography and steganalysis benchmarks.",

Together with the recently established universal approximation result for affine function systems (Bölcskei et al., 2018), this demonstrates that deep neural networks approximate vastly different signal structures generated by the affine group, the Weyl-Heisenberg group, or through warping, and even certain fractals, all with approximation error decaying exponentially in the number of neurons. We also prove that in the approximation of sufficiently smooth functions finite-width deep networks require strictly fewer neurons than finite-depth wide networks.",

    "title": "Coupled Recurrent Models for Polyphonic Music Composition",
    "abstract": "This work describes a novel recurrent model for music composition, which accounts for the rich statistical structure of polyphonic music. There are many ways to factor the probability distribution over musical scores; we consider the merits of various approaches and propose a new factorization that decomposes a score into a collection of concurrent, coupled time series: \"parts.\" The model we propose borrows ideas from both convolutional neural models and recurrent neural models; we argue that these ideas are natural for capturing music's pitch invariances, temporal structure, and polyphony.\n\nWe train generative models for homophonic and polyphonic composition on the KernScores dataset (Sapp, 2005), a collection of 2,300 musical scores comprised of around 2.8 million notes spanning time from the Renaissance to the early 20th century. While evaluation of generative models is know to be hard (Theis et al., 2016), we present careful quantitative results using a unit-adjusted cross entropy metric that is independent of how we factor the distribution over scores. We also present qualitative results using a blind discrimination test.\n",

    "title": "The effectiveness of layer-by-layer training using the information bottleneck principle",
    "abstract": "The recently proposed information bottleneck (IB) theory of deep nets suggests that during training, each layer attempts to maximize its mutual information (MI) with the target labels (so as to allow good prediction accuracy), while minimizing its MI with the input (leading to effective compression and thus good generalization). To date, evidence of this phenomenon has been indirect and aroused controversy due to theoretical and practical complications. In particular, it has been pointed out that the MI with the input is theoretically inﬁnite in many cases of interest, and that the MI with the target is fundamentally difﬁcult to estimate in high dimensions. As a consequence, the validity of this theory has been questioned. In this paper, we overcome these obstacles by two means. First, as previously suggested, we replace the MI with the input by a noise-regularized version, which ensures it is ﬁnite. As we show, this modiﬁed penalty in fact acts as a form of weight decay regularization. Second, to obtain accurate (noise regularized) MI estimates between an intermediate representation and the input, we incorporate the strong prior-knowledge we have about their relation, into the recently proposed MI estimator of Belghazi et al. (2018). With this scheme, we are able to stably train each layer independently to explicitly optimize the IB functional. Surprisingly, this leads to enhanced prediction accuracy, thus directly validating the IB theory of deep nets for the ﬁrst time.",

Our framework exploits low dimensional structure in the target distribution in order to learn a more efficient MCMC sampler. The resulting sampler is able to suppress random walk behaviour and mix between modes efficiently, without the need to compute gradients of the target distribution. We test our sampler on a number of challenging distributions, where the underlying structure is known, and on the task of posterior sampling in Bayesian logistic regression.

    "abstract": "We propose a segmental neural language model that combines the representational power of neural networks and the structure learning mechanism of Bayesian nonparametrics, and show that it learns to discover semantically meaningful units (e.g., morphemes and words) from unsegmented character sequences. The model generates text as a sequence of segments, where each segment is generated either character-by-character from a sequence model or as a single draw from a lexical memory that stores multi-character units. Its parameters are fit to maximize the marginal likelihood of the training data, summing over all segmentations of the input, and its hyperparameters are likewise set to optimize held-out marginal likelihood.\nTo prevent the model from overusing the lexical memory, which leads to poor generalization and bad segmentation, we introduce a differentiable regularizer that penalizes based on the expected length of each segment. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of neural networks that have predictive distributions better than LSTM language models and also infer a segmentation into word-like units that are competitive with the best existing word discovery models.",

    "abstract": "A central goal of unsupervised learning is to acquire representations from unlabeled data or experience that can be used for more effective learning of downstream tasks from modest amounts of labeled data. Many prior unsupervised learning works aim to do so by developing proxy objectives based on reconstruction, disentanglement, prediction, and other metrics. Instead, we develop an unsupervised meta-learning method that explicitly optimizes for the ability to learn a variety of tasks from small amounts of data. To do so, we construct tasks from unlabeled data in an automatic way and run meta-learning over the constructed tasks. Surprisingly, we find that, when integrated with meta-learning, relatively simple task construction mechanisms, such as clustering embeddings, lead to good performance on a variety of downstream, human-specified tasks. Our experiments across four image datasets indicate that our unsupervised meta-learning approach acquires a learning algorithm without any labeled data that is applicable to a wide range of downstream classification tasks, improving upon the embedding learned by four prior unsupervised learning methods.",

    "title": "Connecting the Dots Between MLE and RL for Sequence Generation",
    "abstract": "Sequence generation models such as recurrent networks can be trained with a diverse set of learning algorithms. For example, maximum likelihood learning is simple and efficient, yet suffers from the exposure bias problem. Reinforcement learning like policy gradient addresses the problem but can have prohibitively poor exploration efficiency. A variety of other algorithms such as RAML, SPG, and data noising, have also been developed in different perspectives. This paper establishes a formal connection between these algorithms. We present a generalized entropy regularized policy optimization formulation, and show that the apparently divergent algorithms can all be reformulated as special instances of the framework, with the only difference being the configurations of reward function and a couple of hyperparameters. The unified interpretation offers a systematic view of the varying properties of exploration and learning efficiency. Besides, based on the framework, we present a new algorithm that dynamically interpolates among the existing algorithms for improved learning. Experiments on machine translation and text summarization demonstrate the superiority of the proposed algorithm.",

    "title": "Collapse of deep and narrow neural nets",
    "abstract": "Recent theoretical work has demonstrated that deep neural networks have superior performance over shallow networks, but their training is more difficult, e.g., they suffer from the vanishing gradient problem. This problem can be typically resolved by the rectified linear unit (ReLU) activation. However, here we show that even for such activation, deep and narrow neural networks (NNs) will converge to erroneous mean or median states of the target function depending on the loss with high probability. Deep and narrow NNs are encountered in solving partial differential equations with high-order derivatives. We demonstrate this collapse of such NNs both numerically and theoretically, and provide estimates of the probability of collapse. We also construct a diagram of a safe region for designing NNs that avoid the collapse to erroneous states. Finally, we examine different ways of initialization and normalization that may avoid the collapse problem. Asymmetric initializations may reduce the probability of collapse but do not totally eliminate it.",

    "abstract": "Shallow supervised 1-hidden layer neural networks have a number of favorable properties that make them easier to interpret, analyze, and optimize than their deep counterparts, but lack their representational power.  Here we use 1-hidden layer learning problems to sequentially build deep networks layer by layer, which can inherit properties from shallow networks.  Contrary to previous approaches using shallow networks, we focus on problems where deep learning is reported as critical for success. We thus study CNNs on image recognition tasks using the large-scale Imagenet dataset and the CIFAR-10 dataset.   Using a simple set of ideas for architecture and training we find that solving sequential 1-hidden-layer auxiliary problems leads to a CNN that exceeds AlexNet performance on ImageNet. Extending our training methodology to construct individual layers by solving 2-and-3-hidden layer auxiliary problems, we obtain an 11-layer network that exceeds VGG-11 on ImageNet obtaining 89.8% top-5 single crop. To our knowledge, this is the first competitive alternative to end-to-end training of CNNs that can scale to ImageNet. We conduct a wide range of experiments to study the properties this induces on the intermediate layers.",

    "abstract": "In this work, we propose a goal-driven collaborative task that contains language, vision, and action in a virtual environment as its core components. Specifically, we develop a Collaborative image-Drawing game between two agents, called CoDraw. Our game is grounded in a virtual world that contains movable clip art objects. The game involves two players: a Teller and a Drawer. The Teller sees an abstract scene containing multiple clip art pieces in a semantically meaningful configuration, while the Drawer tries to reconstruct the scene on an empty canvas using available clip art pieces. The two players communicate via two-way communication using natural language. We collect the CoDraw dataset of ~10K dialogs consisting of ~138K messages exchanged between human agents. We define protocols and metrics to evaluate the effectiveness of learned agents on this testbed, highlighting the need for a novel \"crosstalk\" condition which pairs agents trained independently on disjoint subsets of the training data for evaluation. We present models for our task, including simple but effective baselines and neural network approaches trained using a combination of imitation learning and goal-driven training. All models are benchmarked using both fully automated evaluation and by playing the game with live human agents.",

    "title": "PRUNING IN TRAINING: LEARNING AND RANKING SPARSE CONNECTIONS IN DEEP CONVOLUTIONAL NETWORKS",
    "abstract": "This paper proposes a Pruning in Training (PiT) framework of learning to reduce the parameter size of networks. Different from existing works, our PiT framework employs the sparse penalties to train networks and thus help rank the importance of weights and filters. Our PiT algorithms can directly prune the network without any fine-tuning. The pruned networks can still achieve comparable performance to the original networks. In particular, we introduce the (Group) Lasso-type Penalty (L-P /GL-P), and (Group) Split LBI Penalty (S-P / GS-P) to regularize the networks, and a pruning strategy proposed  is used in help prune the network. We conduct the extensive experiments on MNIST, Cifar-10, and miniImageNet. The results validate the efficacy of our proposed methods. Remarkably, on MNIST dataset, our PiT framework can save 17.5% parameter size of LeNet-5, which achieves the 98.47% recognition accuracy.",

    "title": "Kernel Change-point Detection with Auxiliary Deep Generative Models",
    "abstract": "Detecting the emergence of abrupt property changes in time series is a challenging problem. Kernel two-sample test has been studied for this task which makes fewer assumptions on the distributions than traditional parametric approaches. However, selecting kernels is non-trivial in practice. Although kernel selection for the two-sample test has been studied, the insufficient samples in change point detection problem hinder the success of those developed kernel selection algorithms. In this paper, we propose KL-CPD, a novel kernel learning framework for time series CPD that optimizes a lower bound of test power via an auxiliary generative model. With deep kernel parameterization, KL-CPD endows kernel two-sample test with the data-driven kernel to detect different types of change-points in real-world applications. The proposed approach significantly outperformed other state-of-the-art methods in our comparative evaluation of benchmark datasets and simulation studies.",

    "title": "Adversarial Sampling for Active Learning",
    "abstract": "This paper proposes ASAL, a new pool based active learning method that generates high entropy samples. Instead of directly annotating the synthetic samples, ASAL searches similar samples from the pool and includes them for training. Hence, the quality of new samples is high and annotations are reliable.  ASAL is particularly suitable for large data sets because it achieves a better run-time complexity (sub-linear) for sample selection than traditional uncertainty sampling (linear). We present a comprehensive set of experiments on two data sets and show that ASAL outperforms similar methods and clearly exceeds the established baseline (random sampling).  In the discussion section we analyze in which situations ASAL performs best and why it is sometimes hard to outperform random sample selection. To the best of our knowledge this is the first adversarial active learning technique that is applied for multiple class problems using deep convolutional classifiers and demonstrates superior performance than random sample selection.",

    "title": "Self-Monitoring Navigation Agent via Auxiliary Progress Estimation",
    "abstract": "The Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) task entails an agent following navigational instruction in photo-realistic unknown environments. This challenging task demands that the agent be aware of which instruction was completed, which instruction is needed next, which way to go, and its navigation progress towards the goal. In this paper, we introduce a self-monitoring agent with two complementary components: (1) visual-textual co-grounding module to locate the instruction completed in the past, the instruction required for the next action, and the next moving direction from surrounding images and (2) progress monitor to ensure the grounded instruction correctly reflects the navigation progress. We test our self-monitoring agent on a standard benchmark and analyze our proposed approach through a series of ablation studies that elucidate the contributions of the primary components. Using our proposed method, we set the new state of the art by a significant margin (8% absolute increase in success rate on the unseen test set). Code is available at https://github.com/chihyaoma/selfmonitoring-agent.",

    "abstract": "Learning deep neural networks could be understood as the combination of representation learning and learning halfspaces. While most previous work aims to diversify representation learning by data augmentations and regularizations, we explore the opposite direction through the lens of empirical Bayes method. Specifically, we propose a matrix-variate normal prior whose covariance matrix has a Kronecker product structure to capture the correlations in learning different neurons through backpropagation. The prior encourages neurons to learn from the experience of others, hence it provides an effective regularization when training large networks on small datasets. To optimize the model, we design an efficient block coordinate descent algorithm with analytic solutions. Empirically, we show that the proposed method helps the network converge to better local optima that also generalize better, and we verify the effectiveness of the approach on both multiclass classification and multitask regression problems with various network structures.

    "abstract": "The convergence rate and final performance of common deep learning models have significantly benefited from recently proposed heuristics such as learning rate schedules, knowledge distillation, skip connections and normalization layers. In the absence of theoretical underpinnings, controlled experiments aimed at explaining the efficacy of these strategies can aid our understanding of deep learning landscapes and the training dynamics. Existing approaches for empirical analysis rely on tools of linear interpolation and visualizations with dimensionality reduction, each with their limitations. Instead, we revisit the empirical analysis of heuristics through the lens of recently proposed methods for loss surface and representation analysis, viz. mode connectivity and canonical correlation analysis (CCA), and hypothesize reasons why the heuristics succeed. In particular, we explore knowledge distillation and learning rate heuristics of (cosine) restarts and warmup using mode connectivity and CCA.  Our empirical analysis suggests that: (a) the reasons often quoted for the success of cosine annealing are not evidenced in practice; (b) that the effect of learning rate warmup is to prevent the deeper layers from creating training instability; and (c) that the latent knowledge shared by the teacher is primarily disbursed in the deeper layers.",

    "abstract": "Recent advancements on Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) have inspired a wide range of works that generate synthetic images. However, the current processes have to generate an entire image at once, and therefore resolutions are limited by memory or computational constraints. In this work, we propose COnditional COordinate GAN (COCO-GAN), which generates a specific patch of an image conditioned on a spatial position rather than the entire image at a time. The generated patches are later combined together to form a globally coherent full-image. With this process, we show that the generated image can achieve competitive quality to state-of-the-arts and the generated patches are locally smooth between consecutive neighbors. One direct implication of the COCO-GAN is that it can be applied onto any coordinate systems including the cylindrical systems which makes it feasible for generating panorama images. The fact that the patch generation process is independent to each other inspires a wide range of new applications: firstly, \"Patch-Inspired Image Generation\" enables us to generate the entire image based on a single patch. Secondly, \"Partial-Scene Generation\" allows us to generate images within a customized target region. Finally, thanks to COCO-GAN's patch generation and massive parallelism, which enables combining patches for generating a full-image with higher resolution than state-of-the-arts.",

    "abstract": "Semi-supervised learning (SSL) is a study that efficiently exploits a large amount of unlabeled data to improve performance in conditions of limited labeled data. Most of the conventional SSL methods assume that the classes of unlabeled data are included in the set of classes of labeled data. In addition, these methods do not sort out useless unlabeled samples and use all the unlabeled data for learning, which is not suitable for realistic situations. In this paper, we propose an SSL method called selective self-training (SST), which selectively decides whether to include each unlabeled sample in the training process. It is also designed to be applied to a more real situation where classes of unlabeled data are different from the ones of the labeled data. For the conventional SSL problems which deal with data where both the labeled and unlabeled samples share the same class categories, the proposed method not only performs comparable to other conventional SSL algorithms but also can be combined with other SSL algorithms. While the conventional methods cannot be applied to the new SSL problems where the separated data do not share the classes, our method does not show any performance degradation even if the classes of unlabeled data are different from those of the labeled data.",

    "abstract": "Neural random fields (NRFs), which are defined by using neural networks to implement potential functions in undirected models, provide an interesting family of model spaces for machine learning. In this paper we develop a new approach to learning NRFs with inclusive-divergence minimized auxiliary generator - the inclusive-NRF approach, for continuous data (e.g. images), with solid theoretical examination on exploiting gradient information in model sampling. We show that inclusive-NRFs can be flexibly used in unsupervised/supervised image generation and semi-supervised classification, and empirically to the best of our knowledge, represent the best-performed random fields in these tasks. Particularly, inclusive-NRFs achieve state-of-the-art sample generation quality on CIFAR-10 in both unsupervised and supervised settings. Semi-supervised inclusive-NRFs show strong classification results on par with state-of-the-art generative model based semi-supervised learning methods, and simultaneously achieve superior generation, on the widely benchmarked datasets - MNIST, SVHN and CIFAR-10.",

    "title": "MANIFOLDNET: A DEEP NEURAL NETWORK FOR MANIFOLD-VALUED DATA",
    "abstract": "Developing deep neural networks (DNNs) for manifold-valued data sets\nhas gained much interest of late in the deep learning research\ncommunity.  Examples of manifold-valued data include data from\nomnidirectional cameras on automobiles, drones etc., diffusion\nmagnetic resonance imaging, elastography and others. In this paper, we\npresent a novel theoretical framework for DNNs to cope with\nmanifold-valued data inputs.  In doing this generalization, we draw\nparallels to the widely popular convolutional neural networks (CNNs).\nWe call our network the ManifoldNet.\n\nAs in vector spaces where convolutions are equivalent to computing the\nweighted mean of functions, an analogous definition for\nmanifold-valued data can be constructed involving the computation of\nthe weighted Fr\\'{e}chet Mean (wFM). To this end, we present a\nprovably convergent recursive computation of the wFM of the given\ndata, where the weights makeup the convolution mask, to be\nlearned. Further, we prove that the proposed wFM layer achieves a\ncontraction mapping and hence the ManifoldNet does not need the\nadditional non-linear ReLU unit used in standard CNNs. Operations such\nas pooling in traditional CNN are no longer necessary in this setting\nsince wFM is already a pooling type operation. Analogous to the\nequivariance of convolution in Euclidean space to translations, we\nprove that the wFM is equivariant to the action of the group of\nisometries admitted by the Riemannian manifold on which the data\nreside. This equivariance property facilitates weight sharing within\nthe network.  We present experiments, using the ManifoldNet framework,\nto achieve video classification and image reconstruction using an\nauto-encoder+decoder setting. Experimental results demonstrate the\nefficacy of ManifoldNet in the context of classification and\nreconstruction accuracy.",

    "title": "Time-Agnostic Prediction: Predicting Predictable Video Frames",
    "abstract": "Prediction is arguably one of the most basic functions of an intelligent system. In general, the problem of predicting events in the future or between two waypoints is exceedingly difficult. However, most phenomena naturally pass through relatively predictable bottlenecks---while we cannot predict the precise trajectory of a robot arm between being at rest and holding an object up, we can be certain that it must have picked the object up. To exploit this, we decouple visual prediction from a rigid notion of time. While conventional approaches predict frames at regularly spaced temporal intervals, our time-agnostic predictors (TAP) are not tied to specific times so that they may instead discover predictable \"bottleneck\" frames no matter when they occur. We evaluate our approach for future and intermediate frame prediction across three robotic manipulation tasks. Our predictions are not only of higher visual quality, but also correspond to coherent semantic subgoals in temporally extended tasks.",

    "title": "Learning Representations of Categorical Feature Combinations via Self-Attention",
    "abstract": "Self-attention has been widely used to model the sequential data and achieved remarkable results in many applications. Although it can be used to model dependencies without regard to positions of sequences, self-attention is seldom applied to non-sequential data. In this work, we propose to learn representations of multi-field categorical data in prediction tasks via self-attention mechanism, where features are orderless but have intrinsic relations over different fields. In most current DNN based models, feature embeddings are simply concatenated for further processing by networks. Instead, by applying self-attention to transform the embeddings, we are able to relate features in different fields and automatically learn representations of their combinations, which are known as the factors of many prevailing linear models. To further improve the effect of feature combination mining, we modify the original self-attention structure by restricting the similarity weight to have at most k non-zero values, which additionally regularizes the model. We experimentally evaluate the effectiveness of our self-attention model on non-sequential data. Across two click through rate prediction benchmark datasets, i.e., Cretio and Avazu, our model with top-k restricted self-attention achieves the state-of-the-art performance. Compared with the vanilla MLP, the gain by adding self-attention is significantly larger than that by modifying the network structures, which most current works focus on.",

We show that the complete loss function landscape of a neural network can be represented as the quantum state output by a quantum computer. We demonstrate this explicitly for a binary neural network and, further, show how a quantum computer can train the network by manipulating this state using a well-known algorithm known as quantum amplitude amplification. We further show that with minor adaptation, this method can also represent the meta-loss landscape of a number of neural network architectures simultaneously. We search this meta-loss landscape with the same method to simultaneously train and design a binary neural network. ",

    "title": "Aggregated Momentum: Stability Through Passive Damping",
    "abstract": "Momentum is a simple and widely used trick which allows gradient-based optimizers to pick up speed along low curvature directions. Its performance depends crucially on a damping coefficient. Largecamping  coefficients can potentially deliver much larger speedups, but are prone to oscillations and instability; hence one typically resorts to small values such as 0.5 or 0.9. We propose Aggregated Momentum (AggMo), a variant of momentum which combines multiple velocity vectors with different damping coefficients. AggMo is trivial to implement, but significantly dampens oscillations, enabling it to remain stable even for aggressive damping coefficients such as 0.999. We reinterpret Nesterov's accelerated gradient descent as a special case of AggMo and analyze rates of convergence for quadratic objectives. Empirically, we find that AggMo is a suitable drop-in replacement for other momentum methods, and frequently delivers faster convergence with little to no tuning.",

    "abstract": "Nonlinearity is crucial to the performance of a deep (neural) network (DN).\nTo date there has been little progress understanding the menagerie of available  nonlinearities, but recently progress has been made on understanding the r\\^{o}le played by piecewise affine and convex nonlinearities like the ReLU and absolute value activation functions and max-pooling.\nIn particular, DN layers constructed from these operations can be interpreted as {\\em max-affine spline operators} (MASOs) that have an elegant link to vector quantization (VQ) and $K$-means.\nWhile this is good theoretical progress, the entire MASO approach is predicated on the requirement that the nonlinearities be piecewise affine and convex, which precludes important activation functions like the sigmoid, hyperbolic tangent, and softmax.\n{\\em This paper extends the MASO framework to these and an infinitely large class of new nonlinearities by linking deterministic MASOs with probabilistic Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs).}\nWe show that, under a GMM, piecewise affine, convex nonlinearities like ReLU, absolute value, and max-pooling can be interpreted as solutions to certain natural ``hard'' VQ inference problems, while sigmoid, hyperbolic tangent, and softmax can be interpreted as solutions to corresponding ``soft'' VQ inference problems.\nWe further extend the framework by hybridizing the hard and soft VQ optimizations to create a $\\beta$-VQ inference that interpolates between hard, soft, and linear VQ inference.\nA prime example of a $\\beta$-VQ DN nonlinearity is the {\\em swish} nonlinearity, which offers state-of-the-art performance in a range of computer vision tasks but was developed ad hoc by experimentation.\nFinally, we validate with experiments an important assertion of our theory, namely that DN performance can be significantly improved by enforcing orthogonality in its linear filters.\n",

    "abstract": "Deep Neural Networks, being memory and computation intensive, are a challenge to deploy in smaller devices. Numerous quantization techniques have been proposed to reduce the inference latency/memory consumption. However, these techniques impose a large overhead on the training procedure or need to change the training process. We present a non-intrusive quantization technique based on re-training the full precision model, followed by directly optimizing the corresponding binary model. The quantization training process takes no longer than the original training process. We also propose a new loss function to regularize the weights, resulting in reduced quantization error. Combining both help us achieve full precision accuracy on CIFAR dataset using binary quantization. We also achieve full precision accuracy on WikiText-2 using 2 bit quantization. Comparable results are also shown for ImageNet. We also present a 1.5 bits hybrid model exceeding the performance of TWN LSTM model for WikiText-2.",

Theoretically this structure can approximate any continuous function with three layer architecture. But in practice learning  the parameters of such network can be hard. Also the choice of activation function can greatly impact the performance of the network. In this paper we are proposing to replace the basic linear combination operation with non-linear operations that do away with the need of additional non-linear activation function. To this end we are proposing the use of elementary  morphological operations (dilation and erosion) as the basic operation in neurons. We show that these networks (Denoted as Morph-Net) with morphological operations can approximate any smooth function requiring less number of parameters than what is necessary for normal neural networks. The results show that our network perform favorably when compared with similar structured network. We have carried out our experiments on  MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, CIFAR10 and CIFAR100.",

    "title": "Lyapunov-based Safe Policy Optimization",
    "abstract": "In many reinforcement learning applications, it is crucial that the agent interacts with the environment only through safe policies, i.e.,~policies that do not take the agent to certain undesirable situations. These problems are often formulated as a constrained Markov decision process (CMDP) in which the agent's goal is to optimize its main objective while not violating a number of safety constraints. In this paper, we propose safe policy optimization algorithms that are based on the Lyapunov approach to CMDPs, an approach that has well-established theoretical guarantees in control engineering. We first show how to generate a set of state-dependent Lyapunov constraints from the original CMDP safety constraints. We then propose safe policy gradient algorithms that train a neural network policy using DDPG or PPO, while guaranteeing near-constraint satisfaction at every policy update by projecting either the policy parameter or the action onto the set of feasible solutions induced by the linearized Lyapunov constraints. Unlike the existing (safe) constrained PG algorithms, ours are more data efficient as they are able to utilize both on-policy and off-policy data. Furthermore, the action-projection version of our algorithms often leads to less conservative policy updates and allows for natural integration into an end-to-end PG training pipeline. We evaluate our algorithms and compare them with CPO and the Lagrangian method on several high-dimensional continuous state and action simulated robot locomotion tasks, in which the agent must satisfy certain safety constraints while minimizing its expected cumulative cost.

    "title": "G-SGD: Optimizing ReLU Neural Networks in its Positively Scale-Invariant Space",
    "abstract": "It is well known that neural networks with rectified linear units (ReLU) activation functions are positively scale-invariant. Conventional algorithms like stochastic gradient descent optimize the neural networks in the vector space of weights, which is, however, not positively scale-invariant. This mismatch may lead to problems during the optimization process. Then, a natural question is: \\emph{can we construct a new vector space that is positively scale-invariant and sufficient to represent ReLU neural networks so as to better facilitate the optimization process }? In this paper, we provide our positive answer to this question. First, we conduct a formal study on the positive scaling operators which forms a transformation group, denoted as $\\mathcal{G}$. We prove that the value of a path (i.e. the product of the weights along the path) in the neural network is invariant to positive scaling and the value vector of all the paths is sufficient to represent the neural networks under mild conditions. Second, we show that one can identify some basis paths out of all the paths and prove that the linear span of their value vectors (denoted as $\\mathcal{G}$-space) is an invariant space with lower dimension under the positive scaling group. Finally, we design stochastic gradient descent algorithm in $\\mathcal{G}$-space (abbreviated as $\\mathcal{G}$-SGD) to optimize the value vector of the basis paths of neural networks with little extra cost by leveraging back-propagation. Our experiments show that $\\mathcal{G}$-SGD significantly outperforms the conventional SGD algorithm in optimizing ReLU networks on benchmark datasets. ",

    "abstract": "Adversarial training has been recognized as a strong defense against adversarial attacks. In this paper, we propose a powerful second-order attack method that reduces the accuracy of the defense model by Madry et al. (2017). We demonstrate that adversarial training overfits to the choice of the norm in the sense that it is only robust to the attack used for adversarial training, thus suggesting it has not achieved universal robustness. The effectiveness of our attack method motivates an investigation of provable robustness of a defense model. To this end, we introduce a framework that allows one to obtain a certifiable lower bound on the prediction accuracy against adversarial examples. We conduct experiments to show the effectiveness of our attack method. At the same time, our defense model achieves significant improvements compared to previous works under our proposed attack.",

    "abstract": "Deep neural networks are susceptible to adversarial attacks. In computer vision, well-crafted perturbations to images can cause neural networks to make mistakes such as confusing a cat with a computer. Previous adversarial attacks have been designed to degrade performance of models or cause machine learning models to produce specific outputs chosen ahead of time by the attacker. We introduce attacks that instead reprogram the target model to perform a task chosen by the attacker without the attacker needing to specify or compute the desired output for each test-time input. This attack finds a single adversarial perturbation, that can be added to all test-time inputs to a machine learning model in order to cause the model to perform a task chosen by the adversary—even if the model was not trained to do this task. These perturbations can thus be considered a program for the new task. We demonstrate adversarial reprogramming on six ImageNet classification models, repurposing these models to perform a counting task, as well as classification tasks: classification of MNIST and CIFAR-10 examples presented as inputs to the ImageNet model.",

    "abstract": "Acceleration for reinforcement learning methods is an important and challenging theme. We introduce the Anderson acceleration technique into the value iteration, developing an accelerated value iteration algorithm that we call Anderson Accelerated Value Iteration (A2VI). We further apply our method to the Deep Q-learning algorithm, resulting in the Deep Anderson Accelerated Q-learning (DA2Q) algorithm. Our approach can be viewed as an approximation of the policy evaluation by interpolating on historical data. A2VI is more efficient than the modified policy iteration, which is a classical approximate method for policy evaluation. We give a theoretical analysis of our algorithm and conduct experiments on both toy problems and Atari games. Both the theoretical and empirical results show the effectiveness of our algorithm.",

    "title": "Feature Intertwiner for Object Detection",
    "abstract": "A well-trained model should classify objects with unanimous score for every category. This requires the high-level semantic features should be alike among samples, despite a wide span in resolution, texture, deformation, etc. Previous works focus on re-designing the loss function or proposing new regularization constraints on the loss. In this paper, we address this problem via a new perspective. For each category, it is assumed that there are two sets in the feature space: one with more reliable information and the other with less reliable source. We argue that the reliable set could guide the feature learning of the less reliable set during training - in spirit of student mimicking teacher’s behavior and thus pushing towards a more compact class centroid in the high-dimensional space. Such a scheme also benefits the reliable set since samples become more closer within the same category - implying that it is easilier for the classifier to identify. We refer to this mutual learning process as feature intertwiner and embed the spirit into object detection. It is well-known that objects of low resolution are more difficult to detect due to the loss of detailed information during network forward pass. We thus regard objects of high resolution as the reliable set and objects of low resolution as the less reliable set. Specifically, an intertwiner is achieved by minimizing the distribution divergence between two sets. We design a historical buffer to represent all previous samples in the reliable set and utilize them to guide the feature learning of the less reliable set. The design of obtaining an effective feature representation for the reliable set is further investigated, where we introduce the optimal transport (OT) algorithm into the framework. Samples in the less reliable set are better aligned with the reliable set with aid of OT metric. Incorporated with such a plug-and-play intertwiner, we achieve an evident improvement over previous state-of-the-arts on the COCO object detection benchmark.",

To conclude, we show how this reverse point of view not only provides insights into key effects, but also enables to view adversarial examples from different perspectives.",

    "abstract": "Current deep learning based text classification methods are limited by their ability to achieve fast learning and generalization when the data is scarce. We address this problem by integrating a meta-learning procedure that uses the knowledge learned across many tasks as an inductive bias towards better natural language understanding. Inspired by the Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning framework (MAML), we introduce the Attentive Task-Agnostic Meta-Learning (ATAML) algorithm for text classification. The proposed ATAML is designed to encourage task-agnostic representation learning by way of task-agnostic parameterization and facilitate task-specific adaptation via attention mechanisms. We provide evidence to show that the attention mechanism in ATAML has a synergistic effect on learning performance. Our experimental results reveal that, for few-shot text classification tasks, gradient-based meta-learning approaches ourperform popular transfer learning methods. In comparisons with models trained from random initialization, pretrained models and meta trained MAML, our proposed ATAML method generalizes better on single-label and multi-label classification tasks in miniRCV1 and miniReuters-21578 datasets.",

    "abstract": "Modern natural language processing and understanding applications have enjoyed a great boost utilizing neural networks models. However, this is not the case for most languages especially low-resource ones with insufficient annotated training data. Cross-lingual transfer learning methods improve the performance on a low-resource target language by leveraging labeled data from other (source) languages, typically with the help of cross-lingual resources such as parallel corpora. In this work, we propose a zero-resource multilingual transfer learning model that can utilize training data in multiple source languages, while not requiring target language training data nor cross-lingual supervision. Unlike most existing methods that only rely on language-invariant features for cross-lingual transfer, our approach utilizes both language-invariant and language-specific features in a coherent way. Our model leverages adversarial networks to learn language-invariant features and mixture-of-experts models to dynamically exploit the relation between the target language and each individual source language. This enables our model to learn effectively what to share between various languages in the multilingual setup. It results in significant performance gains over prior art, as shown in an extensive set of experiments over multiple text classification and sequence tagging tasks including a large-scale real-world industry dataset.",

    "abstract": "We show that there exists an inherent tension between the goal of adversarial robustness and that of standard generalization. \nSpecifically, training robust models may not only be more resource-consuming, but also lead to a reduction of standard accuracy. We demonstrate that this trade-off between the standard accuracy of a model and its robustness to adversarial perturbations provably exists even in a fairly simple and natural setting. These findings also corroborate a similar phenomenon observed in practice. Further, we argue that this phenomenon is a consequence of robust classifiers learning fundamentally different feature representations than  standard classifiers. These differences, in particular, seem to result in unexpected benefits: the features learned by robust models tend to align better with salient data characteristics and human perception.",

    "abstract": "Over the passage of time Unmanned Autonomous Vehicles (UAVs), especially\nAutonomous flying drones grabbed a lot of attention in Artificial Intelligence.\nSince electronic technology is getting smaller, cheaper and more efficient, huge\nadvancement in the study of UAVs has been observed recently. From monitoring\nfloods, discerning the spread of algae in water bodies to detecting forest trail, their\napplication is far and wide. Our work is mainly focused on autonomous flying\ndrones where we establish a case study towards efficiency, robustness and accuracy\nof UAVs where we showed our results well supported through experiments.\nWe provide details of the software and hardware architecture used in the study. We\nfurther discuss about our implementation algorithms and present experiments that\nprovide a comparison between three different state-of-the-art algorithms namely\nTrailNet, InceptionResnet and MobileNet in terms of accuracy, robustness, power\nconsumption and inference time. In our study, we have shown that MobileNet has\nproduced better results with very less computational requirement and power consumption.\nWe have also reported the challenges we have faced during our work\nas well as a brief discussion on our future work to improve safety features and\nperformance.",

    "abstract": "Invariant and equivariant networks have been successfully used for learning images, sets, point clouds, and graphs. A basic challenge in developing such networks is finding the maximal collection of invariant and equivariant \\emph{linear} layers. Although this question is answered for the first three examples (for popular transformations, at-least), a full characterization of invariant and equivariant linear layers for graphs is not known. \n\nIn this paper we provide a characterization of all permutation invariant and equivariant linear layers for (hyper-)graph data, and show that their dimension, in case of edge-value graph data, is $2$ and $15$, respectively. More generally, for graph data defined on $k$-tuples of nodes, the dimension is the $k$-th and $2k$-th Bell numbers. Orthogonal bases for the layers are computed, including generalization to multi-graph data. The constant number of basis elements and their characteristics allow successfully applying the networks to different size graphs. From the theoretical point of view, our results generalize and unify recent advancement in equivariant deep learning. In particular, we show that our model is capable of approximating any message passing neural network.\n\nApplying these new linear layers in a simple deep neural network framework is shown to achieve comparable results to state-of-the-art and to have better expressivity than previous invariant and equivariant bases.\n",

    "title": "Universal  Stagewise Learning for Non-Convex Problems with  Convergence on  Averaged Solutions",
    "abstract": "Although stochastic gradient descent (SGD) method and its variants (e.g., stochastic momentum methods, AdaGrad) are algorithms of choice for solving non-convex problems (especially deep learning),  big gaps still remain between the theory and the practice with many questions unresolved. For example, there is still a lack of theories of convergence for SGD and its variants that use stagewise step size and return an averaged solution in practice. In addition, theoretical insights of why adaptive step size of AdaGrad could improve non-adaptive step size of SGD is still missing for non-convex optimization.   This paper aims to address these questions and fill the gap between theory and practice. We propose a universal stagewise optimization framework for a broad family of non-smooth non-convex problems with the following key features: (i) at each stage any suitable stochastic convex optimization algorithms (e.g., SGD  or AdaGrad)  that return an averaged solution can be employed for minimizing a regularized convex problem; (ii) the step size is decreased in  a stagewise manner; (iii)  an averaged solution  is returned as the final solution. % that is selected from all stagewise averaged solutions with sampling probabilities  increasing as the stage number. \nOur theoretical results of stagewise {\\ada}  exhibit its adaptive convergence, therefore shed insights on its faster convergence than stagewise SGD  for problems with slowly growing cumulative stochastic gradients. To the best of our knowledge, these new results are the first of their kind for addressing the unresolved issues of existing theories  mentioned earlier. Besides theoretical contributions, our empirical studies show that our stagewise variants of SGD, AdaGrad  improve the generalization performance of existing variants/implementations of SGD and AdaGrad.

    "abstract": "This paper proposes a neural network for classification and regression, without the need to learn layout structures in the output space. Standard solutions such as softmax cross-entropy and mean squared error are effective but parametric, meaning that known inductive structures such as maximum margin separation and simplicity (Occam's Razor) need to be  learned for the task at hand. Instead, we propose polar prototype networks, a class of networks that explicitly states the structure, \\ie the layout, of the output. The structure is defined by polar prototypes, points on the hypersphere of the output space. For classification, each class is described by a single polar prototype and they are a priori distributed with maximal separation and equal shares on the hypersphere. Classes are assigned to prototypes randomly or based on semantic priors and training becomes a matter of minimizing angular distances between examples and their class prototypes. For regression, we show that training can be performed as a polar interpolation between two prototypes, arriving at a regression with higher-dimensional outputs. From empirical analysis, we find that polar prototype networks benefit from large margin separation and semantic class structure, while only requiring a minimal amount of output dimensions. While the structure is simple, the performance is on par with (classification) or better than (regression) standard network methods. Moreover, we show that we gain the ability to perform regression and classification jointly in the same space, which is disentangled and interpretable by design.",

    "abstract": "This paper proposes a representational model for grid cells. In this model, the 2D self-position of the agent is represented by a high-dimensional vector, and the 2D self-motion or displacement of the agent is represented by a matrix that transforms the vector. Each component of the vector is a unit or a cell. The model consists of the following three sub-models. (1) Vector-matrix multiplication. The movement from the current position to the next position is modeled by matrix-vector multi- plication, i.e., the vector of the next position is obtained by multiplying the matrix of the motion to the vector of the current position. (2) Magnified local isometry. The angle between two nearby vectors equals the Euclidean distance between the two corresponding positions multiplied by a magnifying factor. (3) Global adjacency kernel. The inner product between two vectors measures the adjacency between the two corresponding positions, which is defined by a kernel function of the Euclidean distance between the two positions. Our representational model has explicit algebra and geometry. It can learn hexagon patterns of grid cells, and it is capable of error correction, path integral and path planning.",

    "abstract": "While variational dropout approaches have been shown to be effective for network sparsification, they are still suboptimal in the sense that they set the dropout rate for each neuron without consideration of the input data. With such input-independent dropout, each neuron is evolved to be generic across inputs, which makes it difficult to sparsify networks without accuracy loss. To overcome this limitation, we propose adaptive variational dropout whose probabilities are drawn from sparsity-inducing beta-Bernoulli prior. It allows each neuron to be evolved either to be generic or specific for certain inputs, or dropped altogether. Such input-adaptive sparsity-inducing dropout allows the resulting network to tolerate larger degree of sparsity without losing its expressive power by removing redundancies among features. We validate our dependent variational beta-Bernoulli dropout on multiple public datasets, on which it obtains significantly more compact networks than baseline methods, with consistent accuracy improvements over the base networks.",

    "abstract": "Intelligent agents can learn to represent the action spaces of other agents simply by observing them act. Such representations help agents quickly learn to predict the effects of their own actions on the environment and to plan complex action sequences. In this work, we address the problem of learning an agent’s action space purely from visual observation. We use stochastic video prediction to learn a latent variable that captures the scene's dynamics while being minimally sensitive to the scene's static content. We introduce a loss term that encourages the network to capture the composability of visual sequences and show that it leads to representations that disentangle the structure of actions. We call the full model with composable action representations Composable Learned Action Space Predictor (CLASP). We show the applicability of our method to synthetic settings and its potential to capture action spaces in complex, realistic visual settings. When used in a semi-supervised setting, our learned representations perform comparably to existing fully supervised methods on tasks such as action-conditioned video prediction and planning in the learned action space, while requiring orders of magnitude fewer action labels.

    "abstract": "Analogical reasoning has been a principal focus of various waves of AI research. Analogy is particularly challenging for machines because it requires relational structures to be represented such that they can be flexibly applied across diverse domains of experience. Here, we study how analogical reasoning can be induced in neural networks that learn to perceive and reason about raw visual data. We find that the critical factor for inducing such a capacity is not an elaborate architecture, but rather, careful attention to the choice of data and the manner in which it is presented to the model. The most robust capacity for analogical reasoning is induced when networks learn analogies by contrasting abstract relational structures in their input domains, a training method that uses only the input data to force models to learn about important abstract features. Using this technique we demonstrate capacities for complex, visual and symbolic analogy making and generalisation in even the simplest neural network architectures.",

We introduce the notion of conductance\nto extend the notion of attribution to understanding the importance of hidden units.\nInformally, the conductance of a hidden unit of a deep network is the flow of attribution\nvia this hidden unit. We can use conductance to understand the importance of\na hidden unit to the prediction for a specific input, or over a set of inputs. We justify\nconductance in multiple ways via a qualitative comparison with other methods,\nvia some axiomatic results, and via an empirical evaluation based on a feature\nselection task. The empirical evaluations are done using the Inception network\nover ImageNet data, and a convolutinal network over text data. In both cases, we\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of conductance in identifying interesting insights\nabout the internal workings of these networks.",

    "title": "Towards Robust, Locally Linear Deep Networks",
    "abstract": "Deep networks realize complex mappings that are often understood by their locally linear behavior at or around points of interest. For example, we use the derivative of the mapping with respect to its inputs for sensitivity analysis, or to explain (obtain coordinate relevance for) a prediction. One key challenge is that such derivatives are themselves inherently unstable. In this paper, we propose a new learning problem to encourage deep networks to have stable derivatives over larger regions. While the problem is challenging in general, we focus on networks with piecewise linear activation functions. Our algorithm consists of an inference step that identifies a region around a point where linear approximation is provably stable, and an optimization step to expand such regions. We propose a novel relaxation to scale the algorithm to realistic models. We illustrate our method with residual and recurrent networks on image and sequence datasets.",

    "title": "Learning a Meta-Solver for Syntax-Guided Program Synthesis",
    "abstract": "We study a general formulation of program synthesis called syntax-guided synthesis(SyGuS) that concerns synthesizing a program that follows a given grammar and satisfies a given logical specification. Both the logical specification and the grammar have complex structures and can vary from task to task, posing significant challenges for learning across different tasks. Furthermore, training data is often unavailable for domain specific synthesis tasks. To address these challenges, we propose a meta-learning framework that learns a transferable policy from only weak supervision. Our framework consists of three components: 1) an encoder, which embeds both the logical specification and grammar at the same time using a graph neural network; 2) a grammar adaptive policy network which enables learning a transferable policy; and 3) a reinforcement learning algorithm that jointly trains the embedding and adaptive policy. We evaluate the framework on 214 cryptographic circuit synthesis tasks. It solves 141 of them in the out-of-box solver setting, significantly outperforming a similar search-based approach but without learning, which solves only 31. The result is comparable to two state-of-the-art classical synthesis engines, which solve 129 and 153 respectively. In the meta-solver setting, the framework can efficiently adapt to unseen tasks and achieves speedup ranging from 2x up to 100x.",

    "abstract": "End-to-end neural models have made significant progress in question answering, however recent studies show that these models implicitly assume that the answer and evidence appear close together in a single document. In this work, we propose the Coarse-grain Fine-grain Coattention Network (CFC), a new question answering model that combines information from evidence across multiple documents. The CFC consists of a coarse-grain module that interprets documents with respect to the query then finds a relevant answer, and a fine-grain module which scores each candidate answer by comparing its occurrences across all of the documents with the query. We design these modules using hierarchies of coattention and self-attention, which learn to emphasize different parts of the input. On the Qangaroo WikiHop multi-evidence question answering task, the CFC obtains a new state-of-the-art result of 70.6% on the blind test set, outperforming the previous best by 3% accuracy despite not using pretrained contextual encoders.",

Inspired by PFC functionality and connectivity,  as well as human behavior formation process, we propose a novel modular architecture of neural networks with a Behavioral Module (BM) and corresponding end-to-end training strategy.  This approach allows the efficient learning of behaviors and preferences representation. This property is particularly useful for user modeling (as for dialog agents) and recommendation tasks, as allows learning personalized representations of different user states.  In the experiment with video games playing, the resultsshow that the proposed method allows separation of main task’s objectives andbehaviors between different BMs. The experiments also show network extendability through independent learning of new behavior patterns. Moreover, we demonstrate a strategy for an efficient transfer of newly learned BMs to unseen tasks.",

    "abstract": "Different kinds of representation learning techniques on graph have shown significant effect in downstream machine learning tasks. Recently, in order to inductively learn representations for graph structures that is unobservable during training, a general framework with sampling and aggregating (GraphSAGE) was proposed by Hamilton and Ying and had been proved more efficient than transductive methods on fileds like transfer learning or evolving dataset. However, GraphSAGE is uncapable of selective neighbor sampling and lack of memory of known nodes that've been trained. To address these problems, we present an unsupervised method that samples neighborhood information attended by co-occurring structures and optimizes a trainable global bias as a representation expectation for each node in the given graph. Experiments show that our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art inductive and unsupervised methods for representation learning on graphs.",

    "abstract": "We propose a fast second-order method that can be used as a drop-in replacement for current deep learning solvers. Compared to stochastic gradient descent (SGD), it only requires two additional forward-mode automatic differentiation operations per iteration, which has a computational cost comparable to two standard forward passes and is easy to implement. Our method addresses long-standing issues with current second-order solvers, which invert an approximate Hessian matrix every iteration exactly or by conjugate-gradient methods, procedures that are much slower than a SGD step. Instead, we propose to keep a single estimate of the gradient projected by the inverse Hessian matrix, and update it once per iteration with just two passes over the network. This estimate has the same size and is similar to the momentum variable that is commonly used in SGD. No estimate of the Hessian is maintained.\nWe first validate our method, called CurveBall, on small problems with known solutions (noisy Rosenbrock function and degenerate 2-layer linear networks), where current deep learning solvers struggle. We then train several large models on CIFAR and ImageNet, including ResNet and VGG-f networks, where we demonstrate faster convergence with no hyperparameter tuning. We also show our optimiser's generality by testing on a large set of randomly-generated architectures.",

    "abstract": "The backpropagation (BP) algorithm is often thought to be biologically implausible in the brain. One of the main reasons is that BP requires symmetric weight matrices in the feedforward and feedback pathways. To address this “weight transport problem” (Grossberg, 1987), two biologically-plausible algorithms, proposed by Liao et al. (2016) and Lillicrap et al. (2016), relax BP’s weight symmetry requirements and demonstrate comparable learning capabilities to that of BP on small datasets. However, a recent study by Bartunov et al. (2018) finds that although feedback alignment (FA) and some variants of target-propagation (TP) perform well on MNIST and CIFAR, they perform significantly worse than BP on ImageNet. Here, we additionally evaluate the sign-symmetry (SS) algorithm (Liao et al., 2016), which differs from both BP and FA in that the feedback and feedforward weights do not share magnitudes but share signs. We examined the performance of sign-symmetry and feedback alignment on ImageNet and MS COCO datasets using different network architectures (ResNet-18 and AlexNet for ImageNet; RetinaNet for MS COCO). Surprisingly, networks trained with sign-symmetry can attain classification performance approaching that of BP-trained networks. These results complement the study by Bartunov et al. (2018) and establish a new benchmark for future biologically-plausible learning algorithms on more difficult datasets and more complex architectures.",

    "abstract": "We present a new theoretical perspective of data noising in recurrent neural network language models (Xie et al., 2017). We show that each variant of data noising is an instance of Bayesian recurrent neural networks with a particular variational distribution (i.e.,  a mixture of Gaussians whose weights depend on statistics derived from the corpus such as the unigram distribution). We use this insight to propose a more principled  method to apply at prediction time and propose natural extensions to data noising under the variational framework. In particular, we propose variational smoothing  with tied input and output embedding matrices and an element-wise variational smoothing method. We empirically verify our analysis on two benchmark language modeling datasets and demonstrate performance improvements over existing data noising methods.",

    "title": "Amortized Context Vector Inference for Sequence-to-Sequence Networks",
    "abstract": "Neural attention (NA) has become a key component of sequence-to-sequence models that yield state-of-the-art performance in as hard tasks as abstractive document summarization (ADS), machine translation (MT), and video captioning (VC). NA mechanisms perform inference of context vectors; these constitute weighted sums of deterministic input sequence encodings, adaptively sourced over long temporal horizons. Inspired from recent work in the field of amortized variational inference (AVI), in this work we consider treating the context vectors generated by soft-attention (SA) models as latent variables, with approximate finite mixture model posteriors inferred via AVI. We posit that this formulation may yield stronger generalization capacity, in line with the outcomes of existing applications of AVI to deep networks. To illustrate our method, we implement it and experimentally evaluate it considering challenging ADS, VC, and MT benchmarks. This way, we exhibit its improved effectiveness over state-of-the-art alternatives.",

    "title": "Learning protein sequence embeddings using information from structure",
    "abstract": "Inferring the structural properties of a protein from its amino acid sequence is a challenging yet important problem in biology. Structures are not known for the vast majority of protein sequences, but structure is critical for understanding function. Existing approaches for detecting structural similarity between proteins from sequence are unable to recognize and exploit structural patterns when sequences have diverged too far, limiting our ability to transfer knowledge between structurally related proteins. We newly approach this problem through the lens of representation learning. We introduce a framework that maps any protein sequence to a sequence of vector embeddings --- one per amino acid position --- that encode structural information. We train bidirectional long short-term memory (LSTM) models on protein sequences with a two-part feedback mechanism that incorporates information from (i) global structural similarity between proteins and (ii) pairwise residue contact maps for individual proteins. To enable learning from structural similarity information, we define a novel similarity measure between arbitrary-length sequences of vector embeddings based on a soft symmetric alignment (SSA) between them. Our method is able to learn useful position-specific embeddings despite lacking direct observations of position-level correspondence between sequences. We show empirically that our multi-task framework outperforms other sequence-based methods and even a top-performing structure-based alignment method when predicting structural similarity, our goal. Finally, we demonstrate that our learned embeddings can be transferred to other protein sequence problems, improving the state-of-the-art in transmembrane domain prediction.",

    "abstract": "One of the most notable contributions of deep learning is the application of convolutional neural networks (ConvNets) to structured signal classification, and in particular image classification. Beyond their impressive performances in supervised learning, the structure of such networks inspired the development of deep filter banks referred to as scattering transforms. These transforms apply a cascade of wavelet transforms and complex modulus operators to extract features that are invariant to group operations and stable to deformations. Furthermore, ConvNets inspired recent advances in geometric deep learning, which aim to generalize these networks to graph data by applying notions from graph signal processing to learn deep graph filter cascades. We further advance these lines of research by proposing a geometric scattering transform using graph wavelets defined in terms of random walks on the graph. We demonstrate the utility of features extracted with this designed deep filter bank in graph classification of biochemistry and social network data (incl. state of the art results in the latter case), and in data exploration, where they enable inference of EC exchange preferences in enzyme evolution.",

    "title": "Physiological Signal Embeddings (PHASE) via Interpretable Stacked Models",
    "abstract": "In health, machine learning is increasingly common, yet neural network embedding (representation) learning is arguably under-utilized for physiological signals.  This inadequacy stands out in stark contrast to more traditional computer science domains, such as computer vision (CV), and natural language processing (NLP).  For physiological signals, learning feature embeddings is a natural solution to data insufficiency caused by patient privacy concerns -- rather than share data, researchers may share informative embedding models (i.e., representation models), which map patient data to an output embedding.   Here, we present the PHASE (PHysiologicAl Signal Embeddings) framework, which consists of three components: i) learning neural network embeddings of physiological signals, ii) predicting outcomes based on the learned embedding, and iii) interpreting the prediction results by estimating feature attributions in the \"stacked\" models (i.e., feature embedding model followed by prediction model).  PHASE is novel in three ways: 1) To our knowledge, PHASE is the first instance of transferal of neural networks to create physiological signal embeddings. 2) We present a tractable method to obtain feature attributions through stacked models.  We prove that our stacked model attributions can approximate Shapley values -- attributions known to have desirable properties -- for arbitrary sets of models. 3) PHASE was extensively tested in a cross-hospital setting including publicly available data.  In our experiments, we show that PHASE significantly outperforms alternative embeddings -- such as raw, exponential moving average/variance, and autoencoder -- currently in use. Furthermore, we provide evidence that transferring neural network embedding/representation learners between distinct hospitals still yields performant embeddings and offer recommendations when transference is ineffective.",

Thus, the samples near the current decision boundary are considered as the most effective to expedite convergence. Taking advantage of our design, Ada-Boundary maintains its dominance in various degrees of training difficulty. We demonstrate the advantage of Ada-Boundary by extensive experiments using two convolutional neural networks for three benchmark data sets. The experiment results show that Ada-Boundary improves the training time by up to 31.7% compared with the state-of-the-art strategy and by up to 33.5% compared with the baseline strategy.",

    "title": "Improving the Generalization of Adversarial Training with Domain Adaptation",
    "abstract": "By injecting adversarial examples into training data, adversarial training is promising for improving the robustness of deep learning models. However, most existing adversarial training approaches are based on a specific type of adversarial attack. It may not provide sufficiently representative samples from the adversarial domain, leading to a weak generalization ability on adversarial examples from other attacks. Moreover, during the adversarial training, adversarial perturbations on inputs are usually crafted by fast single-step adversaries so as to scale to large datasets. This work is mainly focused on the adversarial training yet efficient FGSM adversary. In this scenario, it is difficult to train a model with great generalization due to the lack of representative adversarial samples, aka the samples are unable to accurately reflect the adversarial domain. To alleviate this problem, we propose a novel Adversarial Training with Domain Adaptation (ATDA) method. Our intuition is to regard the adversarial training on FGSM adversary as a domain adaption task with limited number of target domain samples. The main idea is to learn a representation that is semantically meaningful and domain invariant on the clean domain as well as the adversarial domain. Empirical evaluations on Fashion-MNIST, SVHN, CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 demonstrate that ATDA can greatly improve the generalization of adversarial training and the smoothness of the learned models, and outperforms state-of-the-art methods on standard benchmark datasets. To show the transfer ability of our method, we also extend ATDA to the adversarial training on iterative attacks such as PGD-Adversial Training (PAT) and the defense performance is improved considerably.",

We leverage this property to perform manifold regularization by approximating a variant of the Laplacian norm using a Monte Carlo approximation that is easily computed with the GAN. When incorporated into the semi-supervised feature-matching GAN we achieve state-of-the-art results for semi-supervised learning on CIFAR-10 benchmarks when few labels are used, with a method that is significantly easier to implement than competing methods. We find that manifold regularization improves the quality of generated images, and is affected by the quality of the GAN used to approximate the regularizer.",

A priori one might imagine that the loss function looks like a typical function from $\\mathbb{R}^n$ to $\\mathbb{R}$ - in particular, nonconvex, with discrete global minima.  In this paper, we prove that in at least one important way, the loss function of an overparameterized neural network does not look like a typical function.  If a neural net has $n$ parameters and is trained on $d$ data points, with $n>d$, we show that the locus $M$ of global minima of $L$ is usually not discrete, but rather an $n-d$ dimensional submanifold of $\\mathbb{R}^n$.  In practice, neural nets commonly have orders of magnitude more parameters than data points, so this observation implies that $M$ is typically a very high-dimensional subset of $\\mathbb{R}^n$. ",

IRGAN attempts to leverage the framework for Information-Retrieval (IR), a task that can be described as modeling the correct conditional probability distribution p(d|q) over the documents (d), given the query (q). The work that proposes IRGAN claims that optimizing their minimax loss function will result in a generator which can learn the distribution, but their setup and baseline term steer the model away from an exact adversarial formulation, and this work attempts to point out certain inaccuracies in their formulation. Analyzing their loss curves gives insight into possible mistakes in the loss functions and better performance can be obtained by using the co-training like setup we propose, where two models are trained in a co-operative rather than an adversarial fashion.",

Deep neural networks have been adopted for sensor fusion in a body of recent studies. Among these, the so-called netgated architecture was proposed, which has demonstrated improved performances over the conventional convolu- tional neural networks (CNN). In this paper, we address several limitations of the baseline negated architecture by proposing two further optimized architectures: a coarser-grained gated architecture employing (feature) group-level fusion weights and a two-stage gated architectures leveraging both the group-level and feature- level fusion weights. Using driving mode prediction and human activity recogni- tion datasets, we demonstrate the significant performance improvements brought by the proposed gated architectures and also their robustness in the presence of sensor noise and failures.\n",

    "title": "Deep Imitative Models for Flexible Inference, Planning, and Control",
    "abstract": "Imitation learning provides an appealing framework for autonomous control: in many tasks, demonstrations of preferred behavior can be readily obtained from human experts, removing the need for costly and potentially dangerous online data collection in the real world. However, policies learned with imitation learning have limited flexibility to accommodate varied goals at test time. Model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL) offers considerably more flexibility, since a predictive model learned from data can be used to achieve various goals at test time. However, MBRL suffers from two shortcomings. First, the model does not help to choose desired or safe outcomes -- its dynamics estimate only what is possible, not what is preferred. Second, MBRL typically requires additional online data collection to ensure that the model is accurate in those situations that are actually encountered when attempting to achieve test time goals. Collecting this data with a partially trained model can be dangerous and time-consuming. In this paper, we aim to combine the benefits of imitation learning and MBRL, and propose imitative models: probabilistic predictive models able to plan expert-like trajectories to achieve arbitrary goals. We find this method substantially outperforms both direct imitation and MBRL in a simulated autonomous driving task, and can be learned efficiently from a fixed set of expert demonstrations without additional online data collection. We also show our model can flexibly incorporate user-supplied costs at test-time, can plan to sequences of goals, and can even perform well with imprecise goals, including goals on the wrong side of the road.",

This is especially troublesome given the lack of an evaluation metric that can reliably detect non-convergent behaviors. We leverage the notion of duality gap from game theory in order to propose a novel convergence metric for GANs that has low computational cost. We verify the validity of the proposed metric for various test scenarios commonly used in the literature. ",

    "abstract": "Capsule Networks have shown encouraging results on defacto benchmark computer vision datasets such as MNIST, CIFAR and smallNORB. Although, they are yet to be tested on tasks where (1) the entities detected inherently have more complex internal representations and (2) there are very few instances per class to learn from and (3) where point-wise classification is not suitable. Hence, this paper carries out experiments on face verification in both controlled and uncontrolled settings that together address these points. In doing so we introduce Siamese Capsule Networks, a new variant that can be used for pairwise learning tasks. The model is trained using contrastive loss with l2-normalized capsule encoded pose features. We find that Siamese Capsule Networks perform well against strong baselines on both pairwise learning datasets, yielding best results in the few-shot learning setting where image pairs in the test set contain unseen subjects.",

    "abstract": "A significant challenge for the practical application of reinforcement learning toreal world problems is the need to specify an oracle reward function that correctly defines a task. Inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) seeks to avoid this challenge by instead inferring a reward function from expert behavior.  While appealing, it can be impractically expensive to collect datasets of demonstrations that cover the variation common in the real world (e.g. opening any type of door). Thus in practice, IRL must commonly be performed with only a limited set of demonstrations where it can be exceedingly difficult to unambiguously recover a reward function. In this work, we exploit the insight that demonstrations from other tasks can be used to constrain the set of possible reward functions by learning a \"prior\" that is specifically optimized for the ability to infer expressive reward functions from limited numbers of demonstrations.  We demonstrate that our method can efficiently recover rewards from images for novel tasks and provide intuition as to how our approach is analogous to learning a prior.",

    "abstract": "Understanding theoretical properties of deep and locally connected nonlinear network, such as deep convolutional neural network (DCNN), is still a hard problem despite its empirical success. In this paper, we propose a novel theoretical framework for such networks with ReLU nonlinearity. The framework bridges data distribution with gradient descent rules, favors disentangled representations and is compatible with common regularization techniques such as Batch Norm, after a novel discovery of its projection nature. The framework is built upon teacher-student setting, by projecting the student's forward/backward pass onto the teacher's computational graph. We do not impose unrealistic assumptions (e.g., Gaussian inputs, independence of activation, etc). Our framework could help facilitate theoretical analysis of many practical issues, e.g. disentangled representations in deep networks. ",

First, we are the first to suggest a methodology that aggregates results across input stimuli to gain model-centric results. Second, we linearly approximate the neuron activation and propose to use the outlier weights to identify distributed code. Third, our method constructs a dependency graph of the relevant neurons across the network to gain fine-grained understanding of the nature and interactions of DNN's internal features. The dependency graph illustrates shared subgraphs that generalise across 10 classes and can be clustered into semantically related groups. This is the first step towards building decision trees as an interpretation of learned representations.",

Commonly used dithering strategies, such as\u000f-greedy, try to explore the action-state space randomly; this can lead to large demand for samples. In this paper, We propose an exploration method based on the uncertainty in reward space. There are two policies in this approach, the exploration policy is used for exploratory sampling in the environment, then the benchmark policy try to update by the data proven by the exploration policy. Benchmark policy is used to provide the uncertainty in reward space, e.g. td-error, which guides the exploration policy updating. We apply our method on two grid-world environments and four Atari games. Experiment results show that our method improves learning speed and have a better performance than baseline policies",

    "abstract": "The goal of few-shot learning is to learn a classifier that generalizes well even when trained with a limited number of training instances per class. The recently introduced meta-learning approaches tackle this problem by learning a generic classifier across a large number of multiclass classification tasks and generalizing the model to a new task. Yet, even with such meta-learning, the low-data problem in the novel classification task still remains. In this paper, we propose Transductive Propagation Network (TPN), a novel meta-learning framework for transductive inference that classifies the entire test set at once to alleviate the low-data problem. Specifically, we propose to learn to propagate labels from labeled instances to unlabeled test instances, by learning a graph construction module that exploits the manifold structure in the data. TPN jointly learns both the parameters of feature embedding and the graph construction in an end-to-end manner.  We validate TPN on multiple benchmark datasets, on which it largely outperforms existing few-shot learning approaches and achieves the state-of-the-art results. ",

A decoder is included to approximate the posterior distribution of the data given their representations, where a high fidelity approximation can be achieved by leveraging the informative representations.     \nWe show that the proposed objective is theoretically valid and provides a principled framework for understanding the tradeoffs regarding informativeness of each representation factor, disentanglement of representations, and decoding quality.

    "title": "Inducing Cooperation via Learning to reshape rewards in semi-cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning",
    "abstract": "We propose a deep reinforcement learning algorithm for semi-cooperative multi-agent tasks, where agents are equipped with their separate reward functions, yet with willingness to cooperate. Under these semi-cooperative scenarios, popular methods of centralized training with decentralized execution for inducing cooperation and removing the non-stationarity problem do not work well due to lack of a common shared reward as well as inscalability in centralized training. Our algorithm, called Peer-Evaluation based Dual DQN (PED-DQN), proposes to give peer evaluation signals to observed agents, which quantifies how they feel about a certain transition. This exchange of peer evaluation over time turns out to render agents to gradually reshape their reward functions so that their action choices from the myopic best-response tend to result in the good joint action with high cooperation. This evaluation-based method also allows flexible and scalable training by not assuming knowledge of the number of other agents and their observation and action spaces. We provide the performance evaluation of PED-DQN for the scenarios ranging from a simple two-person prisoner's dilemma to more complex semi-cooperative multi-agent tasks. In special cases where agents share a common reward function as in the centralized training methods, we show that inter-agent\nevaluation leads to better performance\n",

    "title": "Deep Frank-Wolfe For Neural Network Optimization",
    "abstract": "Learning a deep neural network requires solving a challenging optimization problem: it is a high-dimensional, non-convex and non-smooth minimization problem with a large number of terms. The current practice in neural network optimization is to rely on the stochastic gradient descent (SGD) algorithm or its adaptive variants. However, SGD requires a hand-designed schedule for the learning rate. In addition, its adaptive variants tend to produce solutions that generalize less well on unseen data than SGD with a hand-designed schedule. We present an optimization method that offers empirically the best of both worlds: our algorithm yields good generalization performance while requiring only one hyper-parameter. Our approach is based on a composite proximal framework, which exploits the compositional nature of deep neural networks and can leverage powerful convex optimization algorithms by design. Specifically, we employ the Frank-Wolfe (FW) algorithm for SVM, which computes an optimal step-size in closed-form at each time-step. We further show that the descent direction is given by a simple backward pass in the network, yielding the same computational cost per iteration as SGD. We present experiments on the CIFAR and SNLI data sets, where we demonstrate the significant superiority of our method over Adam, Adagrad, as well as the recently proposed BPGrad and AMSGrad. Furthermore, we compare our algorithm to SGD with a hand-designed learning rate schedule, and show that it provides similar generalization while often converging faster. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/oval-group/dfw.",

    "abstract": " As people learn to navigate the world, autonomic nervous system (e.g., ``fight or flight) responses provide intrinsic feedback about the potential consequence of action choices (e.g., becoming nervous when close to a cliff edge or driving fast around a bend.) Physiological changes are correlated with these biological preparations to protect one-self from danger. We present a novel approach to reinforcement learning that leverages a task-independent intrinsic reward function trained on peripheral pulse measurements that are correlated with human autonomic nervous system responses. Our hypothesis is that such reward functions can circumvent the challenges associated with sparse and skewed rewards in reinforcement learning settings and can help improve sample efficiency. We test this in a simulated driving environment and show that it can increase the speed of learning and reduce the number of collisions during the learning stage.",

    "title": "Visual Imitation Learning with Recurrent Siamese Networks",
    "abstract": "People are incredibly skilled at imitating others by simply observing them. They achieve this even in the presence of significant morphological differences and capabilities. Further, people are able to do this from raw perceptions of the actions of others, without direct access to the abstracted demonstration actions and with only partial state information. People therefore solve a difficult problem of understanding the salient features of both observations of others and the relationship to their own state when learning to imitate specific tasks.\nHowever, we can attempt to reproduce a similar demonstration via trail and error and through this gain more understanding of the task space.\nTo reproduce this ability an agent would need to both learn how to recognize the differences between itself and some demonstration and at the same time learn to minimize the distance between its own performance and that of the demonstration.\nIn this paper we propose an approach using only visual information to learn a distance metric between agent behaviour and a given video demonstration.\nWe train an RNN-based siamese model to compute distances in space and time between motion clips while training an RL policy to minimize this distance.\nFurthermore, we examine a particularly challenging form of this problem where the agent must learn an imitation based task given a single demonstration.\nWe demonstrate our approach in the setting of deep learning based control for physical simulation of humanoid walking in both 2D with $10$ degrees of freedom (DoF) and 3D with $38$ DoF.",

    "abstract": "Human scene perception goes beyond recognizing a collection of objects and their pairwise relations. We understand higher-level, abstract regularities within the scene such as symmetry and repetition. Current vision recognition modules and scene representations fall short in this dimension. In this paper, we present scene programs, representing a scene via a symbolic program for its objects, attributes, and their relations. We also propose a model that infers such scene programs by exploiting a hierarchical, object-based scene representation. Experiments demonstrate that our model works well on synthetic data and transfers to real images with such compositional structure. The use of scene programs has enabled a number of applications, such as complex visual analogy-making and scene extrapolation.",

    "title": "An adaptive homeostatic algorithm for the unsupervised learning of visual features",
    "abstract": "The formation of structure in the brain, that is, of the connections between cells within neural populations, is by large an unsupervised learning process: the emergence of this architecture is mostly self-organized. In the primary visual cortex of mammals, for example, one may observe during development the formation of cells selective to localized, oriented features. This leads to the development of a rough representation of contours of the retinal image in area V1. We modeled these mechanisms using sparse Hebbian learning algorithms. These algorithms alternate a coding step to encode the information with a learning step to find the proper encoder. A major difficulty faced by these algorithms is to deduce a good representation while knowing immature encoders, and to learn good encoders with a non-optimal representation. To address this problem, we propose to introduce a new regulation process between learning and coding, called homeostasis. Our homeostasis is compatible with a neuro-mimetic architecture and allows for the fast emergence of localized filters sensitive to orientation. The key to this algorithm lies in a simple adaptation mechanism based on non-linear functions that reconciles the antagonistic processes that occur at the coding and learning time scales. We tested this unsupervised algorithm with this homeostasis rule for a range of existing unsupervised learning algorithms coupled with different neural coding algorithms. In addition, we propose a simplification of this optimal homeostasis rule by implementing a simple heuristic on the probability of activation of neurons. Compared to the optimal homeostasis rule, we show that this heuristic allows to implement a more rapid unsupervised learning algorithm while keeping a large part of its effectiveness. These results demonstrate the potential application of such a strategy in machine learning and we illustrate this with one result in a convolutional neural network.",

    "abstract": "We investigate the properties of multidimensional probability distributions in the context of latent space prior distributions of implicit generative models. Our work revolves around the phenomena arising while decoding linear interpolations between two random latent vectors -- regions of latent space in close proximity to the origin of the space are oversampled, which restricts the usability of linear interpolations as a tool to analyse the latent space. We show that the distribution mismatch can be eliminated completely by a proper choice of the latent probability distribution or using non-linear interpolations. We prove that there is a trade off between the interpolation being linear, and the latent distribution having even the most basic properties required for stable training, such as finite mean. We use the multidimensional Cauchy distribution as an example of the prior distribution, and also provide a general method of creating non-linear interpolations, that is easily applicable to a large family of commonly used latent distributions.",

    "title": "Learning Exploration Policies for Navigation",
    "abstract": "Numerous past works have tackled the problem of task-driven navigation. But, how to effectively explore a new environment to enable a variety of down-stream tasks has received much less attention. In this work, we study how agents can autonomously explore realistic and complex 3D environments without the context of task-rewards. We propose a learning-based approach and investigate different policy architectures, reward functions, and training paradigms. We find that use of policies with spatial memory that are bootstrapped with imitation learning and finally finetuned with coverage rewards derived purely from on-board sensors can be effective at exploring novel environments. We show that our learned exploration policies can explore better than classical approaches based on geometry alone and generic learning-based exploration techniques. Finally, we also show how such task-agnostic exploration can be used for down-stream tasks. Videos are available at https://sites.google.com/view/exploration-for-nav/.",

    "title": "A Mean Field Theory of Batch Normalization",
    "abstract": "We develop a mean field theory for batch normalization in fully-connected feedforward neural networks. In so doing, we provide a precise characterization of signal propagation and gradient backpropagation in wide batch-normalized networks at initialization. Our theory shows that gradient signals grow exponentially in depth and that these exploding gradients cannot be eliminated by tuning the initial weight variances or by adjusting the nonlinear activation function. Indeed, batch normalization itself is the cause of gradient explosion. As a result, vanilla batch-normalized networks without skip connections are not trainable at large depths for common initialization schemes, a prediction that we verify with a variety of empirical simulations. While gradient explosion cannot be eliminated, it can be reduced by tuning the network close to the linear regime, which improves the trainability of deep batch-normalized networks without residual connections. Finally, we investigate the learning dynamics of batch-normalized networks and observe that after a single step of optimization the networks achieve a relatively stable equilibrium in which gradients have dramatically smaller dynamic range. Our theory leverages Laplace, Fourier, and Gegenbauer transforms and we derive new identities that may be of independent interest.",

    "title": "Stable Opponent Shaping in Differentiable Games",
    "abstract": "A growing number of learning methods are actually differentiable games whose players optimise multiple, interdependent objectives in parallel – from GANs and intrinsic curiosity to multi-agent RL. Opponent shaping is a powerful approach to improve learning dynamics in these games, accounting for player influence on others’ updates. Learning with Opponent-Learning Awareness (LOLA) is a recent algorithm that exploits this response and leads to cooperation in settings like the Iterated Prisoner’s Dilemma. Although experimentally successful, we show that LOLA agents can exhibit ‘arrogant’ behaviour directly at odds with convergence. In fact, remarkably few algorithms have theoretical guarantees applying across all (n-player, non-convex) games. In this paper we present Stable Opponent Shaping (SOS), a new method that interpolates between LOLA and a stable variant named LookAhead. We prove that LookAhead converges locally to equilibria and avoids strict saddles in all differentiable games. SOS inherits these essential guarantees, while also shaping the learning of opponents and consistently either matching or outperforming LOLA experimentally.",

    "abstract": "Learning discrete representations of data and then generating data from the discovered representations have been increasingly studied because the obtained discrete representations can benefit unsupervised learning. However, the performance of learning discrete representations of textual data with deep generative models has not been widely explored. In addition, although generative adversarial networks(GAN) have shown impressing results in many areas such as image generation, for text generation, it is notorious for extremely difficult to train. In this work, we propose TopicGAN, a two-step text generative model, which is able to solve those two important problems simultaneously. In the first step, it discovers the latent topics and produced bag-of-words according to the latent topics. In the second step, it generates text from the produced bag-of-words. In our experiments, we show our model can discover meaningful discrete latent topics of texts in an unsupervised fashion and generate high quality natural language from the discovered latent topics.",

    "abstract": "Predicting the time to the next event is an important task in various domains. \nHowever, due to censoring and irregularly sampled sequences, time-to-event prediction has resulted in limited success only for particular tasks, architectures and data. Using recent advances in probabilistic programming and density networks, we make the case for a generalized parametric survival approach, sequentially predicting a distribution over the time to the next event. \nUnlike previous work, the proposed method can use asynchronously sampled features for censored, discrete, and multivariate data. \nFurthermore, it achieves good performance and near perfect calibration for probabilistic predictions without using rigid network-architectures, multitask approaches, complex learning schemes or non-trivial adaptations of cox-models. \nWe firmly establish that this can be achieved in the standard neural network framework by simply switching out the output layer and loss function.",

    "abstract": "Model distillation aims to distill the knowledge of a complex model into a simpler one.  In this paper, we consider an alternative formulation called {\\em dataset distillation}: we keep the model fixed and instead attempt to distill the knowledge from a large training dataset into a small one.  The idea is to {\\em synthesize} a small number of data points that do not need to come from the correct data distribution, but will, when given to the learning algorithm as training data, approximate the model trained on the original data.  For example, we show that it is possible to compress $60,000$ MNIST training images into just $10$ synthetic {\\em distilled images} (one per class) and achieve close to original performance with only a few steps of gradient descent, given a particular fixed network initialization. We evaluate our method in a wide range of initialization settings and with different learning objectives.  Experiments on multiple datasets show the advantage of our approach compared to alternative methods in most settings. ",

    "title": "Beyond Games: Bringing Exploration to Robots in Real-world",
    "abstract": "Exploration has been a long standing problem in both model-based and model-free learning methods for sensorimotor control. While there has been major advances over the years, most of these successes have been demonstrated in either video games or simulation environments. This is primarily because the rewards (even the intrinsic ones) are non-differentiable since they are function of the environment (which is a black-box). In this paper, we focus on the policy optimization aspect of the intrinsic reward function. Specifically, by using a local approximation, we formulate intrinsic reward as a differentiable function so as to perform policy optimization using likelihood maximization -- much like supervised learning instead of reinforcement learning. This leads to a significantly sample efficient exploration policy. Our experiments clearly show that our approach outperforms both on-policy and off-policy optimization approaches like REINFORCE and DQN respectively. But most importantly, we are able to implement an exploration policy on a robot which learns to interact with objects completely from scratch just using data collected via the differentiable exploration module.

    "title": "Diminishing Batch Normalization",
    "abstract": "In this paper, we propose a generalization of the BN algorithm, diminishing batch normalization (DBN), where we update the BN parameters in a diminishing moving average way. Batch normalization (BN) is very effective in accelerating the convergence of a neural network training phase that it has become a common practice. \nOur proposed DBN algorithm remains the overall structure of the original BN algorithm while introduces a weighted averaging update to some trainable parameters. \nWe provide an analysis of the convergence of the DBN algorithm that converges to a stationary point with respect to trainable parameters. Our analysis can be easily generalized for original BN algorithm by setting some parameters to constant. To the best knowledge of authors, this analysis is the first of its kind for convergence with Batch Normalization introduced. We analyze a two-layer model with arbitrary activation function. \nThe primary challenge of the analysis is the fact that some parameters are updated by gradient while others are not. \nThe convergence analysis applies to any activation function that satisfies our common assumptions.\nFor the analysis, we also show the sufficient and necessary conditions for the stepsizes and diminishing weights to ensure the convergence. \nIn the numerical experiments, we use more complex models with more layers and ReLU activation. We observe that DBN outperforms the original BN algorithm on Imagenet, MNIST, NI and CIFAR-10 datasets with reasonable complex FNN and CNN models.",

    "abstract": "Embeddings are a fundamental component of many modern machine learning and natural language processing models.\nUnderstanding them and visualizing them is essential for gathering insights about the information they capture and the behavior of the models.\nState of the art in analyzing embeddings consists in projecting them in two-dimensional planes without any interpretable semantics associated to the axes of the projection, which makes detailed analyses and comparison among multiple sets of embeddings challenging.\nIn this work, we propose to use explicit axes defined as algebraic formulae over embeddings to project them into a lower dimensional, but semantically meaningful subspace, as a simple yet effective analysis and visualization methodology.\nThis methodology assigns an interpretable semantics to the measures of variability and the axes of visualizations, allowing for both comparisons among different sets of embeddings and fine-grained inspection of the embedding spaces.\nWe demonstrate the power of the proposed methodology through a series of case studies that make use of visualizations constructed around the underlying methodology and through a user study. The results show how the methodology is effective at providing more profound insights than classical projection methods and how it is widely applicable to many other use cases.",

    "title": "Graph Convolutional Network with Sequential Attention For Goal-Oriented Dialogue Systems",
    "abstract": "Domain specific goal-oriented dialogue systems typically require modeling three types of inputs, viz., (i) the knowledge-base associated with the domain, (ii) the history of the conversation, which is a sequence of utterances and (iii) the current utterance for which the response needs to be generated. While modeling these inputs, current state-of-the-art models such as Mem2Seq typically ignore the rich structure inherent in the knowledge graph and the sentences in the conversation context. Inspired by the recent success of structure-aware Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) for various NLP tasks such as machine translation, semantic role labeling and document dating, we propose a memory augmented GCN for goal-oriented dialogues. Our model exploits (i) the entity relation graph in a knowledge-base  and (ii) the dependency graph associated with an utterance to compute richer representations for words and entities. Further, we take cognizance of the fact that in certain situations, such as, when the conversation is in a code-mixed language, dependency parsers may not be available. We show that in such situations we could use the global word co-occurrence graph and use it to enrich the representations of utterances. We experiment with the modified DSTC2 dataset and its recently released code-mixed versions in four languages and show that our method outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods, using a wide range of evaluation metrics.",

CoT coordinately trains a generator G and an auxiliary predictive mediator M. The training target of M is to estimate a mixture density of the learned distribution G and the target distribution P, and that of G is to minimize the Jensen-Shannon divergence estimated through M. CoT achieves independent success without the necessity of pre-training via Maximum Likelihood Estimation or involving high-variance algorithms like REINFORCE. This low-variance algorithm is theoretically proved to be superior for both sample generation and likelihood prediction. We also theoretically and empirically show the superiority of CoT over most previous algorithms in terms of generative quality and diversity, predictive generalization ability and computational cost.",

    "title": "RelWalk -- A Latent Variable Model Approach to Knowledge Graph Embedding",
    "abstract": "Knowledge Graph Embedding (KGE) is the task of jointly learning entity and relation embeddings for a given knowledge graph. Existing methods for learning KGEs can be seen as a two-stage process where (a) entities and relations in the knowledge graph are represented using some linear algebraic structures (embeddings), and (b) a scoring function is defined that evaluates the strength of a relation that holds between two entities using the corresponding relation and entity embeddings. Unfortunately, prior proposals for the scoring functions in the first step have been heuristically motivated, and it is unclear as to how the scoring functions in KGEs relate to the generation process of the underlying knowledge graph. To address this issue, we propose a generative account of the KGE learning task. Specifically, given a knowledge graph represented by a set of relational triples (h, R, t), where the semantic relation R holds between the two entities h (head) and t (tail), we extend the random walk model (Arora et al., 2016a) of word embeddings to KGE. We derive a theoretical relationship between the joint probability p(h, R, t) and the embeddings of h, R and t. Moreover, we show that marginal loss minimisation, a popular objective used by much prior work in KGE, follows naturally from the log-likelihood ratio maximisation under the probabilities estimated from the KGEs according to our theoretical relationship. We propose a learning objective motivated by the theoretical analysis to learn KGEs from a given knowledge graph. The KGEs learnt by our proposed method obtain state-of-the-art performance on FB15K237 and WN18RR benchmark datasets, providing empirical evidence in support of the theory.\n",

    "abstract": "Various NLP problems -- such as the prediction of sentence similarity, entailment, and discourse relations -- are all instances of the same general task: the modeling of semantic relations between a pair of textual elements. We call them textual relational problems. A popular model for textual relational problems is to embed sentences into fixed size vectors and use composition functions (e.g. difference or concatenation) of those vectors as features for the prediction. Meanwhile, composition of embeddings has been a main focus within the field of Statistical Relational Learning (SRL) whose goal is to predict relations between entities (typically from knowledge base triples). In this work, we show that textual relational models implicitly use compositions from baseline SRL models. We show that such compositions are not expressive enough for several tasks (e.g. natural language inference).  We build on recent SRL models to address textual relational problems, showing that they are more expressive, and can alleviate issues from simpler compositions. The resulting models significantly improve the state of the art in both transferable sentence representation learning and relation prediction.",

Different from the previous symmetric matrix presentations, the charge transfer channel based on Pauling’s electronegativity is derived from the dependence on real space distance and orbitals for the hetero atomic structures.  This representation can work for the bulk materials as well as the low dimensional nano materials, and can map the R-space and K-space into the pixel space (P-space) by training and testing 130k structures. P-space can well reproduce the R-space quantities within error 0.53. This new asymmetric matrix representation double the information storage than the previous symmetric representations.This work provides a new dimension for the computational chemistry towards the machine learning architecture.

    "title": "An Automatic Operation Batching Strategy for the Backward Propagation of Neural Networks Having Dynamic Computation Graphs",
    "abstract": "Organizing the same operations in the computation graph of a neural network into batches is one of the important methods to improve the speed of training deep learning models and applications since it helps to execute operations with the same type in parallel and to make full use of the available hardware resources. This batching task is usually done by the developers manually and it becomes more dif- ficult when the neural networks have dynamic computation graphs because of the input data with varying structures or the dynamic flow control. Several automatic batching strategies were proposed and integrated into some deep learning toolkits so that the programmers don’t have to be responsible for this task. These strategies, however, will miss some important opportunities to group the operations in the backward propagation of training neural networks. In this paper, we proposed a strategy which provides more efficient automatic batching and brings benefits to the memory access in the backward propagation. We also test our strategy on a variety of benchmarks with dynamic computation graphs. The result shows that it really brings further improvements in the training speed when our strategy is working with the existing automatic strategies.",

    "title": "Don't Settle for Average, Go for the Max: Fuzzy Sets and Max-Pooled Word Vectors",
    "abstract": "Recent literature suggests that averaged word vectors followed by simple post-processing outperform many deep learning methods on semantic textual similarity tasks. Furthermore, when averaged word vectors are trained supervised on large corpora of paraphrases, they achieve state-of-the-art results on standard STS benchmarks. Inspired by these insights, we push the limits of word embeddings even further. We propose a novel fuzzy bag-of-words (FBoW) representation for text that contains all the words in the vocabulary simultaneously but with different degrees of membership, which are derived from similarities between word vectors. We show that max-pooled word vectors are only a special case of fuzzy BoW and should be compared via fuzzy Jaccard index rather than cosine similarity. Finally, we propose DynaMax, a completely unsupervised and non-parametric similarity measure that dynamically extracts and max-pools good features depending on the sentence pair. This method is both efficient and easy to implement, yet outperforms current baselines on STS tasks by a large margin and is even competitive with supervised word vectors trained to directly optimise cosine similarity.",

    "abstract": "Credit assignment in Meta-reinforcement learning (Meta-RL) is still poorly understood. Existing methods either neglect credit assignment to pre-adaptation behavior or implement it naively. This leads to poor sample-efficiency during meta-training as well as ineffective task identification strategies.\nThis paper provides a theoretical analysis of credit assignment in gradient-based Meta-RL. Building on the gained insights we develop a novel meta-learning algorithm that overcomes both the issue of poor credit assignment and previous difficulties in estimating meta-policy gradients. By controlling the statistical distance of both pre-adaptation and adapted policies during meta-policy search, the proposed algorithm endows efficient and stable meta-learning. Our approach leads to superior pre-adaptation policy behavior and consistently outperforms previous Meta-RL algorithms in sample-efficiency, wall-clock time, and asymptotic performance.",

    "abstract": "Neural machine translation (NMT) systems have reached state of the art performance in translating text and are in wide deployment.  Yet little is understood about how these systems function or break.  Here we show that NMT systems are susceptible to producing highly pathological translations that are completely untethered from the source material, which we term hallucinations.  Such pathological translations are problematic because they are are deeply disturbing of user trust and easy to find with a simple search.  We describe a method to generate hallucinations and show that many common variations of the NMT architecture are susceptible to them. We study a variety of approaches to reduce the frequency of hallucinations, including data augmentation, dynamical systems and regularization techniques, showing that data augmentation significantly reduces hallucination frequency. Finally, we analyze networks that produce hallucinations and show that there are signatures in the attention matrix as well as in the hidden states of the decoder.",

This paper presents a general technique toward 8-bit low precision inference of convolutional neural networks, including 1) channel-wise scale factors of weights, especially for depthwise convolution, 2) Winograd convolution, and 3) topology-wise 8-bit support. We experiment the techniques on top of a widely-used deep learning framework. The 8-bit optimized model is automatically generated with a calibration process from FP32 model without the need of fine-tuning or retraining. We perform a systematical and comprehensive study on 18 widely-used convolutional neural networks and demonstrate the effectiveness of 8-bit low precision inference across a wide range of applications and use cases, including image classification, object detection, image segmentation, and super resolution. We show that the inference throughput\nand latency are improved by 1.6X and 1.5X respectively with minimal within 0.6%1to no loss in accuracy from FP32 baseline. We believe the methodology can provide the guidance and reference design of 8-bit low precision inference for other frameworks. All the code and models will be publicly available soon.",

Here we undertake a comparison of four such measures on AlexNet, namely, localist selectivity, \\precision (Zhou et al, ICLR 2015), class-conditional mean activity selectivity CCMAS; (Morcos et al, ICLR 2018), and a new measure called top-class selectivity. In contrast with previous work on recurrent neural networks (RNNs), we fail to find any 100\\% selective `localist units' in AlexNet, and demonstrate that the \\precision and CCMAS measures provide a much higher level of selectivity than is warranted, with the most selective hidden units only responding strongly to a small minority of images from within a category. We also generated activation maximization (AM) images that maximally activated individual units and found that under (5\\%) of units in fc6 and conv5 produced interpretable images of objects, whereas fc8 produced over 50\\% interpretable images. Furthermore, the interpretable images in the hidden layers were not associated with highly selective units. These findings highlight the problem with current selectivity measures and show that new measures are required in order to provide a better assessment of learned representations in NNs.  We also consider why localist representations are learned in RNNs and not AlexNet.",

    "abstract": "Deep learning has achieved remarkable successes in solving challenging reinforcement learning (RL) problems when dense reward function is provided. However, in sparse reward environment it still often suffers from the need to carefully shape reward function to guide policy optimization. This limits the applicability of RL in the real world since both reinforcement learning and domain-specific knowledge are required. It is therefore of great practical importance to develop algorithms which can learn from a binary signal indicating successful task completion or other unshaped, sparse reward signals. We propose a novel method called competitive experience replay, which efficiently supplements a sparse reward by placing learning in the context of an exploration competition between a pair of agents. Our method complements the recently proposed hindsight experience replay (HER) by inducing an automatic exploratory curriculum. We evaluate our approach on the tasks of reaching various goal locations in an ant maze and manipulating objects with a robotic arm. Each task provides only binary rewards indicating whether or not the goal is achieved. Our method asymmetrically augments these sparse rewards for a pair of agents each learning the same task, creating a competitive game designed to drive exploration. Extensive experiments demonstrate that this method leads to faster converge and improved task performance.",

    "title": "Learning Physics Priors for Deep Reinforcement Learing",
    "abstract": "While model-based deep reinforcement learning (RL) holds great promise for sample efficiency and generalization, learning an accurate dynamics model is challenging and often requires substantial interactions with the environment. Further, a wide variety of domains have dynamics that share common foundations like the laws of physics, which are rarely exploited by these algorithms. Humans often acquire such physics priors that allow us to easily adapt to the dynamics of any environment. In this work, we propose an approach to learn such physics priors and incorporate them into an RL agent. Our method involves pre-training a frame predictor on raw videos and then using it to initialize the dynamics prediction model on a target task. Our prediction model, SpatialNet, is designed to implicitly capture localized physical phenomena and interactions.  We show the value of incorporating this prior through empirical experiments on two different domains – a newly created PhysWorld and games from the Atari benchmark, outperforming competitive approaches and demonstrating effective transfer learning.",

    "abstract": "Programming languages are emerging as a challenging and interesting domain for machine learning. A core task, which has received significant attention in recent years, is building generative models of source code. However, to our knowledge, previous generative models have always been framed in terms of generating static snapshots of code. In this work, we instead treat source code as a dynamic object and tackle the problem of modeling the edits that software developers make to source code files. This requires extracting intent from previous edits and leveraging it to generate subsequent edits. We develop several neural networks and use synthetic data to test their ability to learn challenging edit patterns that require strong generalization. We then collect and train our models on a large-scale dataset consisting of millions of fine-grained edits from thousands of Python developers.",

    "abstract": "New estimates for the generalization error are established for a nonlinear regression problem using a two-layer neural network model. These new estimates are a priori in nature in the sense that the bounds depend only on some norms of the underlying functions to be fitted,  not the parameters in the model.  In contrast,  most existing results for neural networks are a posteriori in nature in the sense that the bounds depend on some norms of the model parameters. The error rates are comparable to that of the Monte Carlo method in terms of the size of the dataset.  Moreover, these bounds are equally effective in the over-parametrized regime when the network size is much larger than the size of the dataset. ",

    "abstract": "Neuronal assemblies, loosely defined as subsets of neurons with reoccurring spatio-temporally coordinated activation patterns, or \"motifs\", are thought to be building blocks of neural representations and information processing. We here propose LeMoNADe, a new exploratory data analysis method that facilitates hunting for motifs in calcium imaging videos, the dominant microscopic functional imaging modality in neurophysiology. Our nonparametric method extracts motifs directly from videos, bypassing the difficult intermediate step of spike extraction. Our technique augments variational autoencoders with a discrete stochastic node, and we show in detail how a differentiable reparametrization and relaxation can be used. An evaluation on simulated data, with available ground truth, reveals excellent quantitative performance. In real video data acquired from brain slices, with no ground truth available, LeMoNADe uncovers nontrivial candidate motifs that can help generate hypotheses for more focused biological investigations.",

We propose addressing these issues by using a weighted loss function with a standard convex loss, but with weights on the training examples that are learned to optimize the test metric of interest on the validation set. These metric-optimized example weights can be learned for any test metric, including black box losses and customized metrics for specific applications.  We illustrate the performance of our proposal with public benchmark datasets and real-world applications with domain shift and custom loss functions that balance multiple objectives, impose fairness policies, and are non-convex and non-decomposable.",

We propose a new regularization method based on decoding the last token in the context using the predicted distribution of the next token. This biases the model towards retaining more contextual information, in turn improving its ability to predict the next token. With negligible overhead in the number of parameters and training time, our Past Decode Regularization (PDR) method achieves a word level perplexity of 55.6 on the Penn Treebank and 63.5 on the WikiText-2 datasets using a single softmax. We also show gains by using PDR in combination with a mixture-of-softmaxes, achieving a word level perplexity of 53.8 and 60.5 on these datasets. In addition, our method achieves 1.169 bits-per-character on the Penn Treebank Character dataset for character level language modeling. These results constitute a new state-of-the-art in their respective settings.",

    "abstract": "Deep neural networks provide state-of-the-art performance for image denoising, where the goal is to recover a near noise-free image from a noisy image.\nThe underlying principle is that neural networks trained on large datasets have empirically been shown to be able to generate natural images well from a low-dimensional latent representation of the image.\nGiven such a generator network, or prior, a noisy image can be denoised by finding the closest image in the range of the prior.\nHowever, there is little theory to justify this success, let alone to predict the denoising performance as a function of the networks parameters.\nIn this paper we consider the problem of denoising an image from additive Gaussian noise, assuming the image is well described by a deep neural network with ReLu activations functions, mapping a k-dimensional latent space to an n-dimensional image.\nWe state and analyze a simple gradient-descent-like iterative algorithm that minimizes a non-convex loss function, and provably removes a fraction of (1 - O(k/n)) of the noise energy.\nWe also demonstrate in numerical experiments that this denoising performance is, indeed, achieved by generative priors learned from data.",

    "title": "Curiosity-Driven Experience Prioritization via Density Estimation",
    "abstract": "In Reinforcement Learning (RL), an agent explores the environment and collects trajectories into the memory buffer for later learning. However, the collected trajectories can easily be imbalanced with respect to the achieved goal states. The problem of learning from imbalanced data is a well-known problem in supervised learning, but has not yet been thoroughly researched in RL. To address this problem, we propose a novel Curiosity-Driven Prioritization (CDP) framework to encourage the agent to over-sample those trajectories that have rare achieved goal states. The CDP framework mimics the human learning process and focuses more on relatively uncommon events. We evaluate our methods using the robotic environment provided by OpenAI Gym. The environment contains six robot manipulation tasks. In our experiments, we combined CDP with Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) with or without Hindsight Experience Replay (HER). The experimental results show that CDP improves both performance and sample-efficiency of reinforcement learning agents, compared to state-of-the-art methods.",

    "title": "Making Convolutional Networks Shift-Invariant Again",
    "abstract": "Modern convolutional networks are not shift-invariant, despite their convolutional nature: small shifts in the input can cause drastic changes in the internal feature maps and output. In this paper, we isolate the cause -- the downsampling operation in convolutional and pooling layers -- and apply the appropriate signal processing fix -- low-pass filtering before downsampling. This simple architectural modification boosts the shift-equivariance of the internal representations and consequently, shift-invariance of the output. Importantly, this is achieved while maintaining downstream classification performance. In addition, incorporating the inductive bias of shift-invariance largely removes the need for shift-based data augmentation. Lastly, we observe that the modification induces spatially-smoother learned convolutional kernels. Our results suggest that this classical signal processing technique has a place in modern deep networks.",

    "abstract": "Long training times have increasingly become a burden for researchers by slowing down the pace of innovation, with some models taking days or weeks to train. In this paper, a new, general technique is presented that aims to speed up the training process by using a thinned-down training dataset. By leveraging autoencoders and the unique properties of embedding spaces, we are able to filter training datasets to include only those samples that matter the most. Through evaluation on a standard CIFAR-10 image classification task, this technique is shown to be effective. With this technique, training times can be reduced with a minimal loss in accuracy. Conversely, given a fixed training time budget, the technique was shown to improve accuracy by over 50%. This technique is a practical tool for achieving better results with large datasets and limited computational budgets.",

We will also show an intimate theoretical connection between our method and the theory of optimal transport.",

    "title": "Alignment Based Mathching Networks for One-Shot Classification and Open-Set Recognition",
    "abstract": "Deep learning for object classification relies heavily on convolutional models. While effective, CNNs are rarely interpretable after the fact. An attention mechanism can be used to highlight the area of the image that the model focuses on thus offering a narrow view into the mechanism of classification. We expand on this idea by forcing the method to explicitly align images to be classified to reference images representing the classes. The mechanism of alignment is learned and therefore does not require that the reference objects are anything like those being classified. Beyond explanation, our exemplar based cross-alignment method enables classification with only a single example per category (one-shot). Our model cuts the 5-way, 1-shot error rate in Omniglot from 2.1\\% to 1.4\\% and in MiniImageNet from 53.5\\% to 46.5\\% while simultaneously providing point-wise alignment information providing some understanding on what the network is capturing. This method of alignment also enables the recognition of an unsupported class (open-set) in the one-shot setting while maintaining an F1-score of above 0.5 for Omniglot even with 19 other distracting classes while baselines completely fail to separate the open-set class in the one-shot setting.",

    "abstract": "Learning disentangling representations of the independent factors of variations that explain the data in an unsupervised setting is still a major challenge. In the following paper we address the task of disentanglement and introduce a new state-of-the-art approach called Non-synergistic variational Autoencoder (Non-Syn VAE). Our model draws inspiration from population coding, where the notion of synergy arises when we describe the encoded information by neurons in the form of responses from the stimuli. If those responses convey more information together than separate as independent sources of encoding information, they are acting synergetically. By penalizing the synergistic mutual information within the latents we encourage information independence and by doing that disentangle the latent factors. Notably, our approach could be added to the VAE framework easily, where the new ELBO function is still a lower bound on the log likelihood. In addition, we qualitatively compare our model with Factor VAE and show that this one implicitly minimises the synergy of the latents.",

    "title": "Understanding Straight-Through Estimator in Training Activation Quantized Neural Nets",
    "abstract": "Training activation quantized neural networks involves minimizing a piecewise constant training loss whose gradient vanishes almost everywhere, which is undesirable for the standard back-propagation or chain rule. An empirical way around this issue is to use a straight-through estimator (STE) (Bengio et al., 2013) in the backward pass only, so that the \"gradient\" through the modified chain rule becomes non-trivial. Since this unusual \"gradient\" is certainly not the gradient of loss function, the following question arises: why searching in its negative direction minimizes the training loss? In this paper, we provide the theoretical justification of the concept of STE by answering this question. We consider the problem of learning a two-linear-layer network with binarized ReLU activation and Gaussian input data. We shall refer to the unusual \"gradient\" given by the STE-modifed chain rule as coarse gradient. The choice of STE is not unique. We prove that if the STE is properly chosen, the expected coarse gradient correlates positively with the population gradient (not available for the training), and its negation is a descent direction for minimizing the population loss. We further show the associated coarse gradient descent algorithm converges to a critical point of the population loss minimization problem.  Moreover, we show that a poor choice of STE leads to instability of the training algorithm near certain local minima, which is verified with CIFAR-10 experiments.",

    "title": "Graph Neural Networks with Generated Parameters for Relation Extraction",
    "abstract": "Recently, progress has been made towards improving relational reasoning in machine learning field. Among existing models, graph neural networks (GNNs) is one of the most effective approaches for multi-hop relational reasoning. In fact, multi-hop relational reasoning is indispensable in many natural language processing tasks such as relation extraction. In this paper, we propose to generate the parameters of graph neural networks (GP-GNNs) according to natural language sentences, which enables GNNs to process relational reasoning on unstructured text inputs. We verify GP-GNNs in relation extraction from text. Experimental results on a human-annotated dataset and two distantly supervised datasets show that our model achieves significant improvements compared to the baselines. We also perform a qualitative analysis to demonstrate that our model could discover more accurate relations by multi-hop relational reasoning.",

    "abstract": "There are great interests as well as many challenges in applying reinforcement learning (RL) to recommendation systems. In this setting, an online user is the environment; neither the reward function nor the environment dynamics are clearly defined, making the application of RL challenging. \nIn this paper, we propose a novel model-based reinforcement learning framework for recommendation systems, where we develop a generative adversarial network to imitate user behavior dynamics and learn her reward function. Using this user model as the simulation environment, we develop a novel DQN algorithm to obtain a combinatorial recommendation policy which can handle a large number of candidate items efficiently. In our experiments with real data, we show this generative adversarial user model can better explain user behavior than alternatives, and the RL policy based on this model can lead to a better long-term reward for the user and higher click rate for the system.",

    "abstract": "Robustness of neural networks has recently been highlighted by the adversarial examples, i.e., inputs added with well-designed  perturbations which are imperceptible to humans but can cause the network to give incorrect outputs. In this paper, we design a new CNN architecture that by itself has good robustness. We introduce a simple but powerful technique, Random Mask, to modify existing CNN structures. We show that CNN with Random Mask achieves state-of-the-art performance against black-box adversarial attacks without applying any adversarial training. We next investigate the adversarial examples which “fool” a CNN with Random Mask. Surprisingly, we find that these adversarial examples often “fool” humans as well. This raises fundamental questions on how to define adversarial examples and robustness properly.",

    "abstract": "We consider the problem of information compression from high dimensional data. Where many studies consider the problem of compression by non-invertible trans- formations, we emphasize the importance of invertible compression. We introduce new class of likelihood-based auto encoders with pseudo bijective architecture, which we call Pseudo Invertible Encoders. We provide the theoretical explanation of their principles. We evaluate Gaussian Pseudo Invertible Encoder on MNIST, where our model outperform WAE and VAE in sharpness of the generated images.",

    "title": "Search-Guided, Lightly-supervised Training of  Structured Prediction Energy Networks",
    "abstract": " In structured output prediction tasks, labeling ground-truth training output is often expensive. However, for many tasks, even when the true output is unknown, we can evaluate predictions using a scalar reward function, which may be easily assembled from human knowledge or non-differentiable pipelines.  But searching through the entire output space to find the best output with respect to this reward function is typically intractable.  In this paper, we instead use efficient truncated randomized search in this reward function to train structured prediction energy networks (SPENs), which provide efficient test-time inference using gradient-based search on a smooth, learned representation of the score landscape, and have previously yielded state-of-the-art results in structured prediction.  In particular, this truncated randomized search in the reward function yields previously unknown local improvements, providing effective supervision to SPENs, avoiding their traditional need for labeled training data.

    "abstract": "The success of deep learning research has catapulted deep models into production\nsystems that our society is becoming increasingly dependent on, especially in the\nimage and video domains. However, recent work has shown that these largely\nuninterpretable models exhibit glaring security vulnerabilities in the presence of\nan adversary. In this work, we develop a powerful untargeted adversarial attack\nfor action recognition systems in both white-box and black-box settings. Action\nrecognition models differ from image-classification models in that their inputs\ncontain a temporal dimension, which we explicitly target in the attack. Drawing\ninspiration from image classifier attacks, we create new attacks which achieve\nstate-of-the-art success rates on a two-stream classifier trained on the UCF-101\ndataset. We find that our attacks can significantly degrade a model’s performance\nwith sparsely and imperceptibly perturbed examples. We also demonstrate the\ntransferability of our attacks to black-box action recognition systems.",

    "title": "Controlling Over-generalization and its Effect on Adversarial Examples Detection and Generation",
    "abstract": "Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) significantly improve the state-of-the-art for many applications, especially in computer vision. However, CNNs still suffer from a tendency to confidently classify out-distribution samples from unknown classes into pre-defined known classes. Further, they are also vulnerable to adversarial examples. We are relating these two issues through the tendency of CNNs to over-generalize for areas of the input space not covered well by the training set. We show that a CNN augmented with an extra output class can act as a simple yet effective end-to-end model for controlling over-generalization. As an appropriate training set for the extra class, we introduce two resources that are computationally efficient to obtain: a representative natural out-distribution set and interpolated in-distribution samples. To help select a representative natural out-distribution set among available ones, we propose a simple measurement to assess an out-distribution set's fitness. We also demonstrate that training such an augmented CNN with representative out-distribution natural datasets and some interpolated samples allows it to better handle a wide range of unseen out-distribution samples and black-box adversarial examples without training it on any adversaries. Finally, we show that generation of white-box adversarial attacks using our proposed augmented CNN can become harder, as the attack algorithms have to get around the rejection regions when generating actual adversaries.",

    "abstract": "Reinforcement learning agents are typically trained and evaluated according to their performance averaged over some distribution of environment settings. But does the distribution over environment settings contain important biases, and do these lead to agents that fail in certain cases despite high average-case performance? In this work, we consider worst-case analysis of agents over environment settings in order to detect whether there are directions in which agents may have failed to generalize. Specifically, we consider a 3D first-person task where agents must navigate procedurally generated mazes, and where reinforcement learning agents have recently achieved human-level average-case performance. By optimizing over the structure of mazes, we find that agents can suffer from catastrophic failures, failing to find the goal even on surprisingly simple mazes, despite their impressive average-case performance. Additionally, we find that these failures transfer between different agents and even significantly different architectures. We believe our findings highlight an important role for worst-case analysis in identifying whether there are directions in which agents have failed to generalize. Our hope is that the ability to automatically identify failures of generalization will facilitate development of more general and robust agents. To this end, we report initial results on enriching training with settings causing failure.",

    "abstract": "Deep networks have achieved impressive results across a variety of important tasks. However, a known weakness is a failure to perform well when evaluated on data which differ from the training distribution, even if these differences are very small, as is the case with adversarial examples.  We propose \\emph{Fortified Networks}, a simple transformation of existing networks, which “fortifies” the hidden layers in a deep network by identifying when the hidden states are off of the data manifold, and maps these hidden states back to parts of the data manifold where the network performs well. Our principal contribution is to show that fortifying these hidden states improves the robustness of deep networks and our experiments (i) demonstrate improved robustness to standard adversarial attacks in both black-box and white-box threat models; (ii) suggest that our improvements are not primarily due to the problem of deceptively good results due to degraded quality in the gradient signal (the gradient masking problem) and (iii) show the advantage of doing this fortification in the hidden layers instead of the input space.  We demonstrate improvements in adversarial robustness on three datasets (MNIST, Fashion MNIST, CIFAR10), across several attack parameters, both white-box and black-box settings, and the most widely studied attacks (FGSM, PGD, Carlini-Wagner).  We show that these improvements are achieved across a wide variety of hyperparameters.  ",

    "title": "Transferrable End-to-End Learning for Protein Interface Prediction",
    "abstract": "While there has been an explosion in the number of experimentally determined, atomically detailed structures of proteins, how to represent these structures in a machine learning context remains an open research question.  In this work we demonstrate that representations learned from raw atomic coordinates can outperform hand-engineered structural features while displaying a much higher degree of transferrability.  To do so, we focus on a central problem in biology: predicting how proteins interact with one another—that is, which surfaces of one protein bind to which surfaces of another protein.  We present Siamese Atomic Surfacelet Network (SASNet), the first end-to-end learning method for protein interface prediction.  Despite using only spatial coordinates and identities of atoms as inputs, SASNet outperforms state-of-the-art methods that rely on hand-engineered, high-level features.  These results are particularly striking because we train the method entirely on a significantly biased data set that does not account for the fact that proteins deform when binding to one another.  Demonstrating the first successful application of transfer learning to atomic-level data, our network maintains high performance, without retraining, when tested on real cases in which proteins do deform.",

    "abstract": "In model-based reinforcement learning, the agent interleaves between model learning and planning.  These two components are  inextricably intertwined. If the model is not able to provide sensible long-term prediction, the executed planer would exploit model flaws, which can yield catastrophic failures. This paper focuses on building a model that reasons about the long-term future and demonstrates how to use this for efficient planning and exploration. To this end, we build a latent-variable autoregressive model by leveraging recent ideas in variational inference. We argue that forcing latent variables to carry future information through an auxiliary task substantially improves long-term predictions. Moreover, by planning in the latent space, the planner's solution is ensured to be within regions where the model is valid. An exploration strategy can be devised by searching for unlikely trajectories under the model. Our methods achieves higher reward faster compared to baselines on a variety of tasks and environments in both the imitation learning and model-based reinforcement learning settings. ",

    "abstract": "Unsupervised image-to-image translation is a recently proposed task of translating an image to a different style or domain given only unpaired image examples at training time. In this paper, we formulate a new task of unsupervised video-to-video translation, which poses its own unique challenges. Translating video implies learning not only the appearance of objects and scenes but also realistic motion and transitions between consecutive frames. We investigate the performance of per-frame video-to-video translation using existing image-to-image translation networks, and propose a spatio-temporal 3D translator as an alternative solution to this problem. We evaluate our 3D method on multiple synthetic datasets, such as moving colorized digits, as well as the realistic segmentation-to-video GTA dataset and a new CT-to-MRI volumetric images translation dataset. Our results show that frame-wise translation produces realistic results on a single frame level but underperforms significantly on the scale of the whole video compared to our three-dimensional translation approach, which is better able to learn the complex structure of video and motion and continuity of object appearance.

    "abstract": "The training of deep neural networks with Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) with a large learning rate or a small batch-size typically ends in flat regions of the weight space, as indicated by small eigenvalues of the Hessian of the training loss. This was found to correlate with a good final generalization performance.  In this paper we extend previous work by investigating the curvature of the loss surface along the whole training trajectory, rather than only at the endpoint. We find that initially SGD visits increasingly sharp regions, reaching a maximum sharpness determined by both the learning rate and the batch-size of SGD. At this peak value SGD starts to fail to minimize the loss along directions in the loss surface corresponding to the largest curvature (sharpest directions). To further investigate the effect of these dynamics in the training process, we study a variant of SGD using a reduced learning rate along the sharpest directions which we show can improve training speed while finding both sharper and better generalizing solution, compared to vanilla SGD. Overall, our results show that the SGD dynamics in the subspace of the sharpest directions influence the regions that SGD steers to (where larger learning rate or smaller batch size result in wider regions visited), the overall training speed, and the generalization ability of the final model.",

    "abstract": "Current deep neuroevolution models are usually trained in a large parameter search space for complex learning tasks, e.g. playing video games, which needs billions of samples and thousands of search steps to obtain significant performance. This raises a question of whether we can make use of sequential data generated during evolution, encode input samples, and evolve in low dimensional parameter space with latent state input in a fast and efficient manner. Here we give an affirmative answer: we train a VAE to encode input samples, then an RNN to model environment dynamics and handle temporal information, and last evolve our low dimensional policy network in latent space. We demonstrate that this approach is surprisingly efficient: our experiments on Atari games show that within 10M frames and 30 evolution steps of training, our algorithm could achieve competitive result compared with ES, A3C, and DQN which need billions of frames.",

The proposed solution modifies the update rule, based on the variation of the direction of the gradient during training. We conducted several tests with Adam and AMSGrad on two different  datasets.

As the goal of the agent is to maximize the accumulated reward, it often learns to exploit loopholes and misspecifications in the reward signal resulting in unwanted behavior. While constraints may solve this issue, there is no closed form solution for general constraints. In this work we present a novel multi-timescale approach for constrained policy optimization, called `Reward Constrained Policy Optimization' (RCPO), which uses an alternative penalty signal to guide the policy towards a constraint satisfying one. We prove the convergence of our approach and provide empirical evidence of its ability to train constraint satisfying policies.",

    "abstract": "Convolution is an efficient technique to obtain abstract feature representations using hierarchical layers in deep networks. Although performing convolution in Euclidean geometries is fairly straightforward, its extension to other topological spaces---such as a sphere S^2 or a unit ball B^3---entails unique challenges. In this work, we propose a novel `\"volumetric convolution\" operation that can effectively convolve arbitrary functions in B^3. We develop a theoretical framework for \"volumetric convolution\" based on Zernike polynomials and efficiently implement it as a differentiable and an easily pluggable layer for deep networks. Furthermore, our formulation leads to derivation of a  novel formula to measure the symmetry of a function in B^3 around an arbitrary axis, that is useful in 3D shape analysis tasks. We demonstrate the efficacy of proposed volumetric convolution operation on a possible use-case i.e., 3D object recognition task.",

    "title": "Purchase as Reward : Session-based  Recommendation by Imagination Reconstruction",
    "abstract": "One of the key challenges of session-based recommender systems is to enhance users’ purchase intentions. In this paper, we formulate the sequential interactions between user sessions and a recommender agent as a Markov Decision Process (MDP). In practice, the purchase reward is delayed and sparse, and may be buried by clicks, making it an impoverished signal for policy learning. Inspired by the prediction error minimization (PEM) and embodied cognition, we propose a simple architecture to augment reward, namely Imagination Reconstruction Network (IRN). Speciﬁcally, IRN enables the agent to explore its environment and learn predictive representations via three key components. The imagination core generates predicted trajectories, i.e., imagined items that users may purchase. The trajectory manager controls the granularity of imagined trajectories using the planning strategies, which balances the long-term rewards and short-term rewards. To optimize the action policy, the imagination-augmented executor minimizes the intrinsic imagination error of simulated trajectories by self-supervised reconstruction, while maximizing the extrinsic reward using model-free algorithms. Empirically, IRN promotes quicker adaptation to user interest, and shows improved robustness to the cold-start scenario and ultimately higher purchase performance compared to several baselines. Somewhat surprisingly, IRN using only the purchase reward achieves excellent next-click prediction performance, demonstrating that the agent can \"guess what you like\" via internal planning.",

    "abstract": "Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) excel on many complex perceptual tasks but it has proven notoriously difficult to understand how they reach their decisions. We here introduce a high-performance DNN architecture on ImageNet whose decisions are considerably easier to explain. Our model, a simple variant of the ResNet-50 architecture called BagNet, classifies an image based on the occurrences of small local image features without taking into account their spatial ordering. This strategy is closely related to the bag-of-feature (BoF) models popular before the onset of deep learning and reaches a surprisingly high accuracy on ImageNet (87.6% top-5 for 32 x 32 px features and Alexnet performance for 16 x16 px features). The constraint on local features makes it straight-forward to analyse how exactly each part of the image influences the classification. Furthermore, the BagNets behave similar to state-of-the art deep neural networks such as VGG-16, ResNet-152 or DenseNet-169 in terms of feature sensitivity, error distribution and interactions between image parts. This suggests that the improvements of DNNs over previous bag-of-feature classifiers in the last few years is mostly achieved by better fine-tuning rather than by qualitatively different decision strategies.",

    "title": "On Generalization Bounds of a Family of Recurrent Neural Networks",
    "abstract": "Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) have been widely applied to sequential data analysis. Due to their complicated modeling structures, however, the theory behind is still largely missing. To connect theory and practice, we study the generalization properties of vanilla RNNs as well as their variants, including Minimal Gated Unit (MGU) and Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) RNNs. Specifically, our theory is established under the PAC-Learning framework. The generalization bound is presented in terms of the spectral norms of the weight matrices and the total number of parameters. We also establish refined generalization bounds with additional norm assumptions, and draw a comparison among these bounds. We remark: (1) Our generalization bound for vanilla RNNs is significantly tighter than the best of existing results; (2) We are not aware of any other generalization bounds for MGU and LSTM in the exiting literature; (3) We demonstrate the advantages of these variants in generalization.",

    "abstract": "Word embeddings are known to boost performance of many NLP tasks such as text classification, meanwhile they can be enhanced by labels at the document level to capture nuanced meaning such as sentiment and topic. Can one combine these two research directions to benefit from both? In this paper, we propose to jointly train a text classifier with a label-enhanced and domain-aware word embedding model, using an unlabeled corpus and only a few labeled data from non-target domains. The embeddings are trained on the unlabed corpus and enhanced by pseudo labels coming from the classifier, and at the same time are used by the classifier as input and training signals. We formalize this symbiotic cycle in a variational Bayes framework, and show that our method improves both the embeddings and the text classifier, outperforming state-of-the-art domain adaptation and semi-supervised learning techniques. We conduct detailed ablative tests to reveal gains from important components of our approach. The source code and experiment data will be publicly released.",

    "abstract": "Separating mixed distributions is a long standing challenge for machine learning and signal processing. Applications include: single-channel multi-speaker separation (cocktail party problem), singing voice separation and separating reflections from images. Most current methods either rely on making strong assumptions on the source distributions (e.g. sparsity, low rank, repetitiveness) or rely on having training samples of each source in the mixture. In this work, we tackle the scenario of extracting an unobserved distribution additively mixed with a signal from an observed (arbitrary) distribution. We introduce a new method: Neural Egg Separation - an iterative method that learns to separate the known distribution from progressively finer estimates of the unknown distribution. In some settings, Neural Egg Separation is initialization sensitive, we therefore introduce GLO Masking which ensures a good initialization. Extensive experiments show that our method outperforms current methods that use the same level of supervision and often achieves similar performance to full supervision. ",

However, there are still significant challenges in efficiently learning word representations in the face of paucity of data. In this paper, we propose Soft Decoupled Encoding (SDE), a multilingual lexicon encoding framework specifically designed to share lexical-level information intelligently without requiring heuristic preprocessing such as pre-segmenting the data. SDE represents a word by its spelling through a character encoding, and its semantic meaning through a latent embedding space shared by all languages. Experiments on a standard dataset of four low-resource languages show consistent improvements over strong multilingual NMT baselines, with gains of up to 2 BLEU on one of the tested languages, achieving the new state-of-the-art on all four language pairs.",

    "title": "Adaptive Estimators Show Information Compression in Deep Neural Networks",
    "abstract": "To improve how neural networks function it is crucial to understand their learning process. The information bottleneck theory of deep learning proposes that neural networks achieve good generalization by compressing their representations to disregard information that is not relevant to the task. However, empirical evidence for this theory is conflicting, as compression was only observed when networks used saturating activation functions. In contrast, networks with non-saturating activation functions achieved comparable levels of task performance but did not show compression. In this paper we developed more robust mutual information estimation techniques, that adapt to hidden activity of neural networks and produce more sensitive measurements of activations from all functions, especially unbounded functions. Using these adaptive estimation techniques, we explored compression in networks with a range of different activation functions. With two improved methods of estimation, firstly, we show that saturation of the activation function is not required for compression, and the amount of compression varies between different activation functions. We also find that there is a large amount of variation in compression between different network initializations. Secondary, we see that L2 regularization leads to significantly increased compression, while preventing overfitting. Finally, we show that only compression of the last layer is positively correlated with generalization.",

However, many machine learning tasks have inputs naturally represented as graphs; existing Seq2Seq models face a significant challenge in achieving accurate conversion from graph form to the appropriate sequence. To address this challenge, we introduce a general end-to-end graph-to-sequence neural encoder-decoder architecture that maps an input graph to a sequence of vectors and uses an attention-based LSTM method to decode the target sequence from these vectors. Our method first generates the node and graph embeddings using an improved graph-based neural network with a novel aggregation strategy to incorporate edge direction information in the node embeddings. We further introduce an attention mechanism that aligns node embeddings and the decoding sequence to better cope with large graphs. Experimental results on bAbI, Shortest Path, and Natural Language Generation tasks demonstrate that our model achieves state-of-the-art performance and significantly outperforms existing graph neural networks, Seq2Seq, and Tree2Seq models; using the proposed bi-directional node embedding aggregation strategy, the model can converge rapidly to the optimal performance.",

We show that this approach allows an agent to learn robust policies using only a small number of expert demonstrations and self-supervised interactions with the environment. We derive this approach from first principles and compare it empirically to a state-of-the-art imitation learning method, showing that it outperforms or matches its performance on two simulated robot manipulation tasks and demonstrate significantly higher sample efficiency by applying the algorithm on a real robot.",

In this paper, we bridge the gap between these good empirical results \nand the theoretical approximation capabilities of Deep diagonal-circulant ReLU networks. More precisely, we first demonstrate  that a Deep diagonal-circulant ReLU networks of\nbounded width and small depth can approximate a deep ReLU network in which the dense matrices are\nof low rank. Based on this result, we provide new bounds on the expressive power and universal approximativeness of this type of networks.

    "abstract": "Most deep learning-based models for speech enhancement have mainly focused on estimating the magnitude of spectrogram while reusing the phase from noisy speech for reconstruction. This is due to the difficulty of estimating the phase of clean speech. To improve speech enhancement performance, we tackle the phase estimation problem in three ways. First, we propose Deep Complex U-Net, an advanced U-Net structured model incorporating well-defined complex-valued building blocks to deal with complex-valued spectrograms. Second, we propose a polar coordinate-wise complex-valued masking method to reflect the distribution of complex ideal ratio masks. Third, we define a novel loss function, weighted source-to-distortion ratio (wSDR) loss, which is designed to directly correlate with a quantitative evaluation measure. Our model was evaluated on a mixture of the Voice Bank corpus and DEMAND database, which has been widely used by many deep learning models for speech enhancement. Ablation experiments were conducted on the mixed dataset showing that all three proposed approaches are empirically valid. Experimental results show that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance in all metrics, outperforming previous approaches by a large margin.",

    "abstract": "We propose a new approach to combine Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs) that can be used to solve combinatorial optimization problems. This allows synthesis of larger models from smaller RBMs that have been pretrained, thus effectively bypassing the problem of learning in large RBMs, and creating a system able to model a large, complex multi-modal space. We validate this approach by using learned representations to create ``invertible boolean logic'', where we can use Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) approaches to find the solution to large scale boolean satisfiability problems and show viability towards other combinatorial optimization problems. Using this method, we are able to solve 64 bit addition based problems, as well as factorize 16 bit numbers. We find that these combined representations can provide a more accurate result for the same sample size as compared to a fully trained model.  ",

    "abstract": "Understanding the groundbreaking performance of Deep Neural Networks is one\nof the greatest challenges to the scientific community today. In this work, we\nintroduce an information theoretic viewpoint on the behavior of deep networks\noptimization processes and their generalization abilities. By studying the Information\nPlane, the plane of the mutual information between the input variable and\nthe desired label, for each hidden layer. Specifically, we show that the training of\nthe network is characterized by a rapid increase in the mutual information (MI)\nbetween the layers and the target label, followed by a longer decrease in the MI\nbetween the layers and the input variable. Further, we explicitly show that these\ntwo fundamental information-theoretic quantities correspond to the generalization\nerror of the network, as a result of introducing a new generalization bound that is\nexponential in the representation compression. The analysis focuses on typical\npatterns of large-scale problems. For this purpose, we introduce a novel analytic\nbound on the mutual information between consecutive layers in the network.\nAn important consequence of our analysis is a super-linear boost in training time\nwith the number of non-degenerate hidden layers, demonstrating the computational\nbenefit of the hidden layers.",

    "title": "Episodic Curiosity through Reachability",
    "abstract": "Rewards are sparse in the real world and most of today's reinforcement learning algorithms struggle with such sparsity. One solution to this problem is to allow the agent to create rewards for itself - thus making rewards dense and more suitable for learning. In particular, inspired by curious behaviour in animals, observing something novel could be rewarded with a bonus. Such bonus is summed up with the real task reward - making it possible for RL algorithms to learn from the combined reward. We propose a new curiosity method which uses episodic memory to form the novelty bonus. To determine the bonus, the current observation is compared with the observations in memory. Crucially, the comparison is done based on how many environment steps it takes to reach the current observation from those in memory - which incorporates rich information about environment dynamics. This allows us to overcome the known \"couch-potato\" issues of prior work - when the agent finds a way to instantly gratify itself by exploiting actions which lead to hardly predictable consequences. We test our approach in visually rich 3D environments in ViZDoom, DMLab and MuJoCo. In navigational tasks from ViZDoom and DMLab, our agent outperforms the state-of-the-art curiosity method ICM. In MuJoCo, an ant equipped with our curiosity module learns locomotion out of the first-person-view curiosity only. The code is available at https://github.com/google-research/episodic-curiosity/.",

    "title": "Variational Sparse Coding",
    "abstract": "Variational auto-encoders\n (VAEs) offer a tractable approach when performing approximate inference in otherwise intractable generative models. However, standard VAEs often produce latent codes that are disperse and lack interpretability, thus making the resulting representations unsuitable for auxiliary tasks (e.g. classiﬁcation) and human interpretation. We address these issues by merging ideas from variational auto-encoders and sparse coding, and propose to explicitly model sparsity in the latent space of a VAE with a Spike and Slab prior distribution. We derive the evidence lower bound using a discrete mixture recognition function thereby making approximate posterior inference as computational efﬁcient as in the standard VAE case. With the new approach, we are able to infer truly sparse representations with generally intractable non-linear probabilistic models. We show that these sparse representations are advantageous over standard VAE representations on two benchmark classiﬁcation tasks (MNIST and Fashion-MNIST) by demonstrating improved classiﬁcation accuracy and signiﬁcantly increased robustness to the number of latent dimensions. Furthermore, we demonstrate qualitatively that the sparse elements capture subjectively understandable sources of variation.",

    "title": "Graph2Seq: Scalable Learning Dynamics for Graphs",
    "abstract": "Neural networks have been shown to be an effective tool for learning algorithms over graph-structured data. However, graph representation techniques---that convert graphs to real-valued vectors for use with neural networks---are still in their infancy. Recent works have proposed several approaches (e.g., graph convolutional networks), but these methods have difficulty scaling and generalizing to graphs with different sizes and shapes. We present Graph2Seq, a new technique that represents vertices of graphs as infinite time-series. By not limiting the representation to a fixed dimension, Graph2Seq scales naturally to graphs of arbitrary sizes and shapes. Graph2Seq is also reversible, allowing full recovery of the graph structure from the sequence. By analyzing a formal computational model for graph representation, we show that an unbounded sequence is necessary for scalability. Our experimental results with Graph2Seq show strong generalization and new state-of-the-art performance on a variety of graph combinatorial optimization problems.\n",

    "abstract": "The input method is an essential service on every mobile and desktop devices that provides text suggestions. It converts sequential keyboard inputs to the characters in its target language, which is indispensable for Japanese and Chinese users. Due to critical resource constraints and limited network bandwidth of the target devices, applying neural models to input method is not well explored. In this work, we apply a LSTM-based language model to input method and evaluate its performance for both prediction and conversion tasks with Japanese BCCWJ corpus. We articulate the bottleneck to be the slow softmax computation during conversion. To solve the issue, we propose incremental softmax approximation approach, which computes softmax with a selected subset vocabulary and fix the stale probabilities when the vocabulary is updated in future steps. We refer to this method as incremental selective softmax. The results show a two order speedup for the softmax computation when converting Japanese input sequences with a large vocabulary, reaching real-time speed on commodity CPU. We also exploit the model compressing potential to achieve a 92% model size reduction without losing accuracy.",

In fact, they form an aristocratic graph with a latent hierarchical structure that the next generation of unsupervised learned word embeddings should reveal. In this paper, justified by the notion of delta-hyperbolicity or tree-likeliness of a space, we propose to embed words in a Cartesian product of hyperbolic spaces which we theoretically connect to the Gaussian word embeddings and their Fisher geometry. This connection allows us to introduce a novel principled hypernymy score for word embeddings. Moreover, we adapt the well-known Glove algorithm to learn unsupervised word embeddings in this type of Riemannian manifolds. We further explain how to solve the analogy task using the Riemannian parallel transport that generalizes vector arithmetics to this new type of geometry. Empirically, based on extensive experiments, we prove that our embeddings, trained unsupervised, are the first to simultaneously outperform strong and popular baselines on the tasks of similarity, analogy and hypernymy detection. In particular, for word hypernymy, we obtain new state-of-the-art on fully unsupervised WBLESS classification accuracy.",

    "abstract": "Neural networks models are known to be vulnerable to geometric transformations\nas well as small pixel-wise perturbations of input. Convolutional Neural Networks\n(CNNs) are translation-equivariant but can be easily fooled using rotations and\nsmall pixel-wise perturbations. Moreover, CNNs require sufficient translations in\ntheir training data to achieve translation-invariance. Recent work by Cohen &\nWelling (2016), Worrall et al. (2016), Kondor & Trivedi (2018), Cohen & Welling\n(2017), Marcos et al. (2017), and Esteves et al.

In this paper, we do an extensive empirical study of various\nrotation-equivariant neural network models to understand how effectively they\nlearn rotations. This includes Group-equivariant Convolutional Networks (GCNNs)\nby Cohen & Welling (2016), Harmonic Networks (H-Nets) by Worrall et al.\n(2016), Polar Transformer Networks (PTN) by Esteves et al. (2018) and Rotation\nequivariant vector field networks by Marcos et al. (2017). We empirically compare\nthe ability of these networks to learn rotations efficiently in terms of their\nnumber of parameters, sample complexity, rotation augmentation used in training.\nWe compare them against each other as well as Standard CNNs. We observe\nthat as these rotation-equivariant neural networks learn rotations, they instead become\nmore vulnerable to small pixel-wise adversarial attacks, e.g., Fast Gradient\nSign Method (FGSM) and Projected Gradient Descent (PGD), in comparison with\nStandard CNNs. In other words, robustness to geometric transformations in these\nmodels comes at the cost of robustness to small pixel-wise perturbations.",

    "abstract": "The architecture search methods for convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have shown promising results. These methods require significant computational resources, as they repeat the neural network training many times to evaluate and search the architectures. Developing the computationally efficient architecture search method is an important research topic. In this paper, we assume that the structure parameters of CNNs are categorical variables, such as types and connectivities of layers, and they are regarded as the learnable parameters. Introducing the multivariate categorical distribution as the underlying distribution for the structure parameters, we formulate a differentiable loss for the training task, where the training of the weights and the optimization of the parameters of the distribution for the structure parameters are coupled. They are trained using the stochastic gradient descent, leading to the optimization of the structure parameters within a single training. We apply the proposed method to search the architecture for two computer vision tasks: image classification and inpainting. The experimental results show that the proposed architecture search method is fast and can achieve comparable performance to the existing methods.",

    "abstract": "Self-attention is a useful mechanism to build generative models for language and images. It determines the importance of context elements by comparing each element to the current time step. In this paper, we show that a very lightweight convolution can perform competitively to the best reported self-attention results. Next, we introduce dynamic convolutions which are simpler and more efficient than self-attention. We predict separate convolution kernels based solely on the current time-step in order to determine the importance of context elements. The number of operations required by this approach scales linearly in the input length, whereas self-attention is quadratic. Experiments on large-scale machine translation, language modeling and abstractive summarization show that dynamic convolutions improve over strong self-attention models. On the WMT'14 English-German test set dynamic convolutions achieve a new state of the art of 29.7 BLEU.",

    "abstract": "Federated learning is a recent advance in privacy protection. \nIn this context, a trusted curator aggregates parameters optimized in decentralized fashion by multiple clients. The resulting model is then distributed back to all clients, ultimately converging to a joint representative model without explicitly having to share the data. \nHowever, the protocol is vulnerable to differential attacks, which could originate from any party contributing during federated optimization. In such an attack, a client's contribution during training and information about their data set is revealed through analyzing the distributed model. \nWe tackle this problem and propose an algorithm for client sided differential privacy preserving federated optimization. The aim is to hide clients' contributions during training, balancing the trade-off between privacy loss and model performance. \nEmpirical studies suggest that given a sufficiently large number of participating clients, our proposed procedure can maintain client-level differential privacy at only a minor cost in model performance.

    "abstract": "The notion of the stationary equilibrium ensemble has played a central role in statistical mechanics. In machine learning as well, training serves as generalized equilibration that drives the probability distribution of model parameters toward stationarity. Here, we derive stationary fluctuation-dissipation relations that link measurable quantities and hyperparameters in the stochastic gradient descent algorithm. These relations hold exactly for any stationary state and can in particular be used to adaptively set training schedule. We can further use the relations to efficiently extract information pertaining to a loss-function landscape such as the magnitudes of its Hessian and anharmonicity. Our claims are empirically verified.",

    "abstract": "Machine learning models that take computer program source code as input typically use Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. However, a major challenge is that code is written using an open, rapidly changing vocabulary due to, e.g., the coinage of new variable and method names.  Reasoning over such a vocabulary is not something for which most NLP methods are designed.  We introduce a Graph-Structured Cache to address this problem; this cache contains a node for each new word the model encounters with edges connecting each word to its occurrences in the code.  We find that combining this graph-structured cache strategy with recent Graph-Neural-Network-based models for supervised learning on code improves the models' performance on a code completion task and a variable naming task --- with over 100\\% relative improvement on the latter --- at the cost of a moderate increase in computation time.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we propose a novel adversarial learning framework, namely DelibGAN, for generating high-quality sentences without supervision. Our framework consists of a coarse-to-fine generator, which contains a first-pass decoder and a second-pass decoder, and a multiple instance discriminator. And we propose two training mechanisms DelibGAN-I and DelibGAN-II. The discriminator is used to fine-tune the second-pass decoder in DelibGAN-I and further evaluate the importance of each word and tune the first-pass decoder in DelibGAN-II. We compare our models with several typical and state-of-the-art unsupervised generic text generation models on three datasets (a synthetic dataset, a descriptive text dataset and a sentimental text dataset). Both qualitative and quantitative experimental results show that our models produce more realistic samples, and DelibGAN-II performs best.",

    "title": "Measuring and regularizing networks in function space",
    "abstract": "To optimize a neural network one often thinks of optimizing its parameters, but it is ultimately a matter of optimizing the function that maps inputs to outputs. Since a change in the parameters might serve as a poor proxy for the change in the function, it is of some concern that primacy is given to parameters but that the correspondence has not been tested. Here, we show that it is simple and computationally feasible to calculate distances between functions in a $L^2$ Hilbert space. We examine how typical networks behave in this space, and compare how parameter $\\ell^2$ distances compare to function $L^2$ distances between various points of an optimization trajectory. We find that the two distances are nontrivially related. In particular, the $L^2/\\ell^2$ ratio decreases throughout optimization, reaching a steady value around when test error plateaus. We then investigate how the $L^2$ distance could be applied directly to optimization. We first propose that in multitask learning, one can avoid catastrophic forgetting by directly limiting how much the input/output function changes between tasks. Secondly, we propose a new learning rule that constrains the distance a network can travel through $L^2$-space in any one update. This allows new examples to be learned in a way that minimally interferes with what has previously been learned. These applications demonstrate how one can measure and regularize function distances directly, without relying on parameters or local approximations like loss curvature.",

In contrast, standard NNs propagate only point estimates, discarding the uncertainty.\nMethods propagating also the variance have been proposed by several authors in different context. The view presented here attempts to clarify the assumptions and derivation behind such methods, relate them to classical NNs and broaden their scope of applicability.\nThe main technical contributions are new approximations for the distributions of argmax and max-related transforms, which allow for fully analytic uncertainty propagation in networks with softmax and max-pooling layers as well as leaky ReLU activations.\nWe evaluate the accuracy of the approximation and suggest a simple calibration. Applying the method to networks with dropout allows for faster training and gives improved test likelihoods without the need of sampling.",

    "title": "A Convergence Analysis of Gradient Descent for Deep Linear Neural Networks",
    "abstract": "We analyze speed of convergence to global optimum for gradient descent training a deep linear neural network by minimizing the L2 loss over whitened data.  Convergence at a linear rate is guaranteed when the following hold: (i) dimensions of hidden layers are at least the minimum of the input and output dimensions; (ii) weight matrices at initialization are approximately balanced; and (iii) the initial loss is smaller than the loss of any rank-deficient solution.  The assumptions on initialization (conditions (ii) and (iii)) are necessary, in the sense that violating any one of them may lead to convergence failure.  Moreover, in the important case of output dimension 1, i.e. scalar regression, they are met, and thus convergence to global optimum holds, with constant probability under a random initialization scheme.  Our results significantly extend previous analyses, e.g., of deep linear residual networks (Bartlett et al., 2018).",

    "abstract": "Studying the evolution of information theoretic quantities during Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) learning of Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) has gained popularity in recent years. \nNevertheless, these type of experiments require estimating mutual information and entropy which becomes intractable for moderately large problems. In this work we propose a framework for understanding SGD learning in the information plane which consists of observing entropy and conditional entropy of the output labels of ANN. Through experimental results and theoretical justifications it is shown that, under some assumptions, the SGD learning trajectories appear to be similar for different ANN architectures. First, the SGD learning is modeled as a Hidden Markov Process (HMP) whose entropy tends to increase to the maximum. Then, it is shown that the SGD learning trajectory appears to move close to the shortest path between the initial and final joint distributions in the space of probability measures equipped with the total variation metric. Furthermore, it is shown that the trajectory of learning in the information plane can provide an alternative for observing the learning process, with potentially richer information about the learning than the trajectories in training and test error.

    "abstract": "Discretizing floating-point vectors is a fundamental step of modern indexing methods. State-of-the-art techniques learn parameters of the quantizers on training data for optimal performance, thus adapting quantizers to the data. In this work, we propose to reverse this paradigm and adapt the data to the quantizer: we train a neural net whose last layers form a fixed parameter-free quantizer, such as pre-defined points of a sphere. As a proxy objective, we design and train a neural network that favors uniformity in the spherical latent space, while preserving the neighborhood structure after the mapping.  For this purpose, we propose a new regularizer derived from the Kozachenko-Leonenko differential entropy estimator and combine it with a locality-aware triplet loss. \nExperiments show that our end-to-end approach outperforms most learned quantization methods, and is competitive with the state of the art on widely adopted benchmarks. Further more, we show that training without the quantization step results in almost no difference in accuracy, but yields a generic catalyser that can be applied with any subsequent quantization technique.\n",

    "abstract": "Our goal is to train a policy for autonomous driving via imitation learning that is robust enough to drive a real vehicle. We find that standard behavior cloning is insufficient for handling complex driving scenarios, even when we leverage a perception system for preprocessing the input and a controller for executing the output on the car: 30 million examples are still not enough. We propose exposing the learner to synthesized data in the form of perturbations to the expert's driving, which creates interesting situations such as collisions and/or going off the road. Rather than purely imitating all data, we augment the imitation loss with additional losses that penalize undesirable events and encourage progress -- the perturbations then provide an important signal for these losses and lead to robustness of the learned model. We show that the model can handle complex situations in simulation, and present ablation experiments that emphasize the importance of each of our proposed changes and show that the model is responding to the appropriate causal factors. Finally, we demonstrate the model driving a car in the real world ( https://sites.google.com/view/learn-to-drive ).",

    "title": "Heated-Up Softmax Embedding",
    "abstract": "Metric learning aims at learning a distance which is consistent with the semantic meaning of the samples. The problem is generally solved by learning an embedding, such that the samples of the same category are close (compact) while samples from different categories are far away (spread-out) in the embedding space. One popular way of generating such embeddings is to use the second-to-last layer of a deep neural network trained as a classifier with the softmax cross-entropy loss. In this paper, we show that training classifiers with different temperatures of the softmax function lead to different distributions of the embedding space. And finding a balance between the compactness, 'spread-out' and the generalization ability of the feature is critical in metric learning. Leveraging these insights, we propose a 'heating-up' strategy to train a classifier with increasing temperatures. Extensive experiments show that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art embeddings on a variety of metric learning benchmarks. ",

    "title": "Infinitely Deep Infinite-Width Networks",
    "abstract": "Infinite-width neural networks have been extensively used to study the theoretical properties underlying the extraordinary empirical success of standard, finite-width neural networks. Nevertheless, until now, infinite-width networks have been limited to at most two hidden layers. To address this shortcoming, we study the initialisation requirements of these networks and show that the main challenge for constructing them is defining the appropriate sampling distributions for the weights. Based on these observations, we propose a principled approach to weight initialisation that correctly accounts for the functional nature of the hidden layer activations and facilitates the construction of arbitrarily many infinite-width layers, thus enabling the construction of arbitrarily deep infinite-width networks. The main idea of our approach is to iteratively reparametrise the hidden-layer activations into appropriately defined reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces and use the canonical way of constructing probability distributions over these spaces for specifying the required weight distributions in a principled way. Furthermore, we examine the practical implications of this construction for standard, finite-width networks. In particular, we derive a novel weight initialisation scheme for standard, finite-width networks that takes into account the structure of the data and information about the task at hand. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this weight initialisation approach on the MNIST, CIFAR-10 and Year Prediction MSD datasets.",

    "title": "DANA: Scalable Out-of-the-box Distributed ASGD Without Retuning",
    "abstract": "Distributed computing can significantly reduce the training time of neural networks. Despite its potential, however, distributed training has not been widely adopted: scaling the training process is difficult, and existing SGD methods require substantial tuning of hyperparameters and learning schedules to achieve sufficient accuracy when increasing the number of workers. In practice, such tuning can be prohibitively expensive given the huge number of potential hyperparameter configurations and the effort required to test each one.\n    \nWe propose DANA, a novel approach that scales out-of-the-box to large clusters using the same hyperparameters and learning schedule optimized for training on a single worker, while maintaining similar final accuracy without additional overhead. DANA estimates the future value of model parameters by adapting Nesterov Accelerated Gradient to a distributed setting, and so mitigates the effect of gradient staleness, one of the main difficulties in scaling SGD to more workers.\n\nEvaluation on three state-of-the-art network architectures and three datasets shows that DANA scales as well as or better than existing work without having to tune any hyperparameters or tweak the learning schedule. For example, DANA achieves 75.73% accuracy on ImageNet when training ResNet-50 with 16 workers, similar to the non-distributed baseline.",

    "title": "Manifold Alignment via Feature Correspondence",
    "abstract": "We propose a novel framework for combining datasets via alignment of their associated intrinsic dimensions. Our approach assumes that the two datasets are sampled from a common latent space, i.e., they measure equivalent systems. Thus, we expect there to exist a natural (albeit unknown) alignment of the data manifolds associated with the intrinsic geometry of these datasets, which are perturbed by measurement artifacts in the sampling process. Importantly, we do not assume any individual correspondence (partial or complete) between data points. Instead, we rely on our assumption that a subset of data features have correspondence across datasets. We leverage this assumption to estimate relations between intrinsic manifold dimensions, which are given by diffusion map coordinates over each of the datasets. We compute a correlation matrix between diffusion coordinates of the datasets by considering graph (or manifold) Fourier coefficients of corresponding data features. We then orthogonalize this correlation matrix to form an isometric transformation between the diffusion maps of the datasets. Finally, we apply this transformation to the diffusion coordinates and construct a unified diffusion geometry of the datasets together. We show that this approach successfully corrects misalignment artifacts, and allows for integrated data.",

    "abstract": "Learning world dynamics has recently been investigated as a way to make reinforcement\nlearning (RL) algorithms to be more sample efficient and interpretable.\nIn this paper, we propose to capture an environment dynamics with a novel forward\nmodel that leverages recent works on adversarial learning and visual control. Such\na model estimates future observations conditioned on the current ones and other\ninput variables such as actions taken by an RL-agent. We focus on image generation\nwhich is a particularly challenging topic but our method can be adapted to\nother modalities. More precisely, our forward model is trained to produce realistic\nobservations of the future while a discriminator model is trained to distinguish\nbetween real images and the model’s prediction of the future. This approach overcomes\nthe need to define an explicit loss function for the forward model which is currently\nused for solving such a class of problem. As a consequence, our learning protocol\ndoes not have to rely on an explicit distance such as Euclidean distance which\ntends to produce unsatisfactory predictions. To illustrate our method, empirical\nqualitative and quantitative results are presented on a real driving scenario, along\nwith qualitative results on Atari game Frostbite.",

    "abstract": "Deep neural networks (DNNs) have achieved impressive predictive performance due to their ability to learn complex, non-linear relationships between variables. However, the inability to effectively visualize these relationships has led to DNNs being characterized as black boxes and consequently limited their applications. To ameliorate this problem, we introduce the use of hierarchical interpretations to explain DNN predictions through our proposed method: agglomerative contextual decomposition (ACD). Given a prediction from a trained DNN, ACD produces a hierarchical clustering of the input features, along with the contribution of each cluster to the final prediction. This hierarchy is optimized to identify clusters of features that the DNN learned are predictive. We introduce ACD using examples from Stanford Sentiment Treebank and ImageNet, in order to diagnose incorrect predictions, identify dataset bias, and extract polarizing phrases of varying lengths. Through human experiments, we demonstrate that ACD enables users both to identify the more accurate of two DNNs and to better trust a DNN's outputs. We also find that ACD's hierarchy is largely robust to adversarial perturbations, implying that it captures fundamental aspects of the input and ignores spurious noise.",

    "abstract": "We study an interesting problem in training neural network-based models for natural language generation tasks, which we call the \\emph{representation degeneration problem}. We observe that when training a model for natural language generation tasks through likelihood maximization with the weight tying trick, especially with big training datasets, most of the learnt word embeddings tend to degenerate and be distributed into a narrow cone, which largely limits the representation power of word embeddings. We analyze the conditions and causes of this problem and propose a novel regularization method to address it. Experiments on language modeling and machine translation show that our method can largely mitigate the representation degeneration problem and achieve better performance than baseline algorithms.",

    "title": "Attentive Neural Processes",
    "abstract": "Neural Processes (NPs) (Garnelo et al., 2018) approach regression by learning to map a context set of observed input-output pairs to a distribution over regression functions. Each function models the distribution of the output given an input, conditioned on the context. NPs have the benefit of fitting observed data efficiently with linear complexity in the number of context input-output pairs, and can learn a wide family of conditional distributions; they learn predictive distributions conditioned on context sets of arbitrary size. Nonetheless, we show that NPs suffer a fundamental drawback of underfitting, giving inaccurate predictions at the inputs of the observed data they condition on. We address this issue by incorporating attention into NPs, allowing each input location to attend to the relevant context points for the prediction. We show that this greatly improves the accuracy of predictions, results in noticeably faster training, and expands the range of functions that can be modelled. ",

    "abstract": "Deep learning systems have become ubiquitous in many aspects of our lives. Unfortunately, it has been shown that such systems are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, making them prone to potential unlawful uses. \nDesigning deep neural networks that are robust to adversarial attacks is a fundamental step in making such systems safer and deployable in a broader variety of applications (e.g. autonomous driving), but more importantly is a necessary step to design novel and more advanced architectures built on new computational paradigms rather than marginally building on the existing ones.\nIn this paper we introduce PeerNets, a novel family of convolutional networks alternating classical Euclidean convolutions with graph convolutions to harness information from a graph of peer samples. This results in a form of non-local forward propagation in the model, where latent features are conditioned on the global structure induced by the graph, that is up to 3 times more robust to a variety of white- and black-box adversarial attacks compared to conventional architectures with almost no drop in accuracy.",

    "abstract": "We propose a generalization error bound for a general family of deep neural networks based on the depth and width of the networks, as well as the spectral norm of weight matrices. Through introducing a novel characterization of the Lipschitz properties of neural network family, we achieve a tighter generalization error bound. We further obtain a result that is free of linear dependence on norms for bounded losses. Besides the general deep neural networks, our results can be applied to derive new bounds for several popular architectures, including convolutional neural networks (CNNs), residual networks (ResNets), and hyperspherical networks (SphereNets).  When achieving same generalization errors with previous arts, our bounds allow for the choice of much larger parameter spaces of weight matrices, inducing potentially stronger expressive ability for neural networks.",

    "abstract": "A key feature of neural networks, particularly deep convolutional neural networks, is their ability to learn useful representations from data. The very last layer of a neural network is then simply a linear model trained on these learned representations. Despite their numerous applications in other tasks such as classification, retrieval, clustering etc., a.k.a. transfer learning, not much work has been published that investigates the structure of these representations or indeed whether structure can be imposed on them during the training process.\n\nIn this paper, we study the effective dimensionality of the learned representations  by models that have proved highly successful for image classification.  We focus on ResNet-18, ResNet-50 and VGG-19 and  observe that when trained on CIFAR10 or CIFAR100, the learned representations exhibit a fairly low rank structure.  We propose a modification to the training procedure,  which further encourages low rank structure on learned activations.  Empirically, we show that this has implications for  robustness to adversarial examples  and compression.",

    "abstract": "Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have proven to be a powerful framework for learning to draw samples from complex distributions. However, GANs are also notoriously difficult to train, with mode collapse and oscillations a common problem. We hypothesize that this is at least in part due to the evolution of the generator distribution and the catastrophic forgetting tendency of neural networks, which leads to the discriminator losing the ability to remember synthesized samples from previous instantiations of the generator. Recognizing this, our contributions are twofold. First, we show that GAN training makes for a more interesting and realistic benchmark for continual learning methods evaluation than some of the more canonical datasets. Second, we propose leveraging continual learning techniques to augment the discriminator, preserving its ability to recognize previous generator samples. We show that the resulting methods add only a light amount of computation, involve minimal changes to the model, and result in better overall performance on the examined image and text generation tasks.",

Spectral Inference Networks generalize Slow Feature Analysis to generic symmetric operators, and are closely related to Variational Monte Carlo methods from computational physics. As such, they can be a powerful tool for unsupervised representation learning from video or graph-structured data. We cast training Spectral Inference Networks as a bilevel optimization problem, which allows for online learning of multiple eigenfunctions. We show results of training Spectral Inference Networks on problems in quantum mechanics and feature learning for videos on synthetic datasets. Our results demonstrate that Spectral Inference Networks accurately recover eigenfunctions of linear operators and can discover interpretable representations from video in a fully unsupervised manner.",

    "title": "Spatial-Winograd Pruning Enabling Sparse Winograd Convolution",
    "abstract": "Deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are deployed in various applications but demand immense computational requirements. Pruning techniques and Winograd convolution are two typical methods to reduce the CNN computation. However, they cannot be directly combined because Winograd transformation fills in the sparsity resulting from pruning. Li et al. (2017) propose sparse Winograd convolution in which weights are directly pruned in the Winograd domain, but this technique is not very practical because Winograd-domain retraining requires low learning rates and hence significantly longer training time. Besides, Liu et al. (2018) move the ReLU function into the Winograd domain, which can help increase the weight sparsity but requires changes in the network structure. To achieve a high Winograd-domain weight sparsity without changing network structures, we propose a new pruning method, spatial-Winograd pruning. As the first step, spatial-domain weights are pruned in a structured way, which efficiently transfers the spatial-domain sparsity into the Winograd domain and avoids Winograd-domain retraining. For the next step, we also perform pruning and retraining directly in the Winograd domain but propose to use an importance factor matrix to adjust weight importance and weight gradients. This adjustment makes it possible to effectively retrain the pruned Winograd-domain network without changing the network structure. For the three models on the datasets of CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet, our proposed method can achieve the Winograd-domain sparsities of 63%, 50%, and 74%, respectively.",

    "abstract": "Contextualized representation models such as ELMo (Peters et al., 2018a) and BERT (Devlin et al., 2018) have recently achieved state-of-the-art results on a diverse array of downstream NLP tasks. Building on recent token-level probing work, we introduce a novel edge probing task design and construct a broad suite of sub-sentence tasks derived from the traditional structured NLP pipeline. We probe word-level contextual representations from four recent models and investigate how they encode sentence structure across a range of syntactic, semantic, local, and long-range phenomena. We find that existing models trained on language modeling and translation produce strong representations for syntactic phenomena, but only offer comparably small improvements on semantic tasks over a non-contextual baseline.",

    "abstract": "This work presents a new strategy for multi-class classification that requires no class-specific labels, but instead leverages pairwise similarity between examples, which is a weaker form of annotation. The proposed method, meta classification learning, optimizes a binary classifier for pairwise similarity prediction and through this process learns a multi-class classifier as a submodule. We formulate this approach, present a probabilistic graphical model for it, and derive a surprisingly simple loss function that can be used to learn neural network-based models. We then demonstrate that this same framework generalizes to the supervised, unsupervised cross-task, and semi-supervised settings. Our method is evaluated against state of the art in all three learning paradigms and shows a superior or comparable accuracy, providing evidence that learning multi-class classification without multi-class labels is a viable learning option.",

    "title": "DEEP GRAPH TRANSLATION",
    "abstract": "The tremendous success of deep generative models on generating continuous data\nlike image and audio has been achieved; however, few deep graph generative models\nhave been proposed to generate discrete data such as graphs. The recently proposed\napproaches are typically unconditioned generative models which have no\ncontrol over modes of the graphs being generated. Differently, in this paper, we\nare interested in a new problem named Deep Graph Translation: given an input\ngraph, the goal is to infer a target graph by learning their underlying translation\nmapping. Graph translation could be highly desirable in many applications such\nas disaster management and rare event forecasting, where the rare and abnormal\ngraph patterns (e.g., traffic congestions and terrorism events) will be inferred prior\nto their occurrence even without historical data on the abnormal patterns for this\nspecific graph (e.g., a road network or human contact network). To this end, we\npropose a novel Graph-Translation-Generative Adversarial Networks (GT-GAN)\nwhich translates one mode of the input graphs to its target mode. GT-GAN consists\nof a graph translator where we propose new graph convolution and deconvolution\nlayers to learn the global and local translation mapping. A new conditional\ngraph discriminator has also been proposed to classify target graphs by conditioning\non input graphs. Extensive experiments on multiple synthetic and real-world\ndatasets demonstrate the effectiveness and scalability of the proposed GT-GAN.",

    "abstract": "In this paper we introduce a simple, robust approach to hierarchically training an agent in the setting of sparse reward tasks.\nThe agent is split into a low-level and a high-level policy. The low-level policy only accesses internal, proprioceptive dimensions of the state observation. The low-level policies are trained with a simple reward that encourages changing the values of the non-proprioceptive dimensions. Furthermore, it is induced to be periodic with the use a ``phase function.'' The high-level policy is trained using a sparse, task-dependent reward, and operates by choosing which of the low-level policies to run at any given time. Using this approach, we solve difficult maze and navigation tasks with sparse rewards using the Mujoco Ant and Humanoid agents and show improvement over recent hierarchical methods. ",

    "abstract": "We propose an adversarial learning approach to the generation of multi-turn dialogue responses. Our proposed framework, hredGAN, is based on conditional generative adversarial networks (GANs). The GAN's generator is a modified hierarchical recurrent encoder-decoder network (HRED) and the discriminator is a word-level bidirectional RNN that shares context and word embedding with the generator. During inference, noise samples conditioned on the dialogue history are used to perturb the generator's latent space to generate several possible responses. The final response is the one ranked best by the discriminator. The hredGAN shows major advantages over existing methods: (1) it generalizes better than networks trained using only the log-likelihood criterion, and (2) it generates longer, more informative and more diverse responses with high utterance and topic relevance even with limited training data. This superiority is demonstrated on the Movie triples and Ubuntu dialogue datasets with both the automatic and human evaluations.",

    "title": "Learning to Schedule Communication in Multi-agent Reinforcement Learning",
    "abstract": "Many real-world reinforcement learning tasks require multiple agents to make sequential decisions under the agents’ interaction, where well-coordinated actions among the agents are crucial to achieve the target goal better at these tasks. One way to accelerate the coordination effect is to enable multiple agents to communicate with each other in a distributed manner and behave as a group. In this paper, we study a practical scenario when (i) the communication bandwidth is limited and (ii) the agents share the communication medium so that only a restricted number of agents are able to simultaneously use the medium, as in the state-of-the-art wireless networking standards. This calls for a certain form of communication scheduling. In that regard, we propose a multi-agent deep reinforcement learning framework, called SchedNet, in which agents learn how to schedule themselves, how to encode the messages, and how to select actions based on received messages. SchedNet is capable of deciding which agents should be entitled to broadcasting their (encoded) messages, by learning the importance of each agent’s partially observed information. We evaluate SchedNet against multiple baselines under two different applications, namely, cooperative communication and navigation, and predator-prey. Our experiments show a non-negligible performance gap between SchedNet and other mechanisms such as the ones without communication and with vanilla scheduling methods, e.g., round robin, ranging from 32% to 43%.",

    "abstract": "We present a representation for describing transition models in complex uncertain domains using relational rules.  For any action, a rule selects a set of relevant objects and computes a distribution over properties of just those objects in the resulting state given their properties in the previous state.  An iterative greedy algorithm is used to construct a set of deictic references that determine which objects are relevant in any given state.   Feed-forward neural networks are used to learn the transition distribution on the relevant objects' properties.  This strategy is demonstrated to be both more versatile and more sample efficient than learning a monolithic transition model in a simulated domain in which a robot pushes stacks of objects on a cluttered table.",

    "abstract": "We propose a novel method for incorporating conditional information into a generative adversarial network (GAN) for structured prediction tasks. This method is based on fusing features from the generated and conditional information in feature space and allows the discriminator to better capture higher-order statistics from the data. This method also increases the strength of the signals passed through the network where the real or generated data and the conditional data agree. The proposed method is conceptually simpler than the joint convolutional neural network - conditional Markov random field (CNN-CRF) models and enforces higher-order consistency without being limited to a very specific class of high-order potentials. Experimental results demonstrate that this method leads to improvement on a variety of different structured prediction tasks including image synthesis, semantic segmentation, and depth estimation.",

    "abstract": "We propose a new sample-efficient methodology, called Supervised Policy Update (SPU), for deep reinforcement learning. Starting with data generated by the current policy, SPU formulates and solves a constrained optimization problem in the non-parameterized proximal policy space. Using supervised regression, it then converts the optimal non-parameterized policy to a parameterized policy, from which it draws new samples. The methodology is general in that it applies to both discrete and continuous action spaces, and can handle a wide variety of proximity constraints for the non-parameterized optimization problem. We show how the Natural Policy Gradient and Trust Region Policy Optimization (NPG/TRPO) problems, and the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) problem can be addressed by this methodology. The SPU implementation is much simpler than TRPO. In terms of sample efficiency, our extensive experiments show SPU outperforms TRPO in Mujoco simulated robotic tasks and outperforms PPO in Atari video game tasks.",

    "abstract": "Although generative adversarial networks (GANs) have enabled us to convert images from one domain to another similar one, converting between different sensory modalities, such as images and sounds, has been difficult. This study aims to propose a network that reconstructs images from sounds. First, video data with both images and sounds are labeled with pre-trained classifiers. Second, image and sound features are extracted from the data using pre-trained classifiers. Third, multimodal layers are introduced to extract features that are common to both the images and sounds. These layers are trained to extract similar features regardless of the input modality, such as images only, sounds only, and both images and sounds. Once the multimodal layers have been trained, features are extracted from input sounds and converted into image features using a feature-to-feature GAN. Finally, the generated image features are used to reconstruct images. Experimental results show that this method can successfully convert from the sound domain into the image domain. When we applied a pre-trained classifier to both the generated and original images, 31.9% of the examples had at least one of their top 10 labels in common, suggesting reasonably good image generation. Our results suggest that common representations can be learned for different modalities, and that proposed method can be applied not only to sound-to-image conversion but also to other conversions, such as from images to sounds.",

Based on the previous work on Riemannian Langevin dynamics, we propose the stochastic gradient functional Riemannian dynamics for training functional Bayesian neural network. We show the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed approach with various experiments. ",

    "abstract": "We study the problem of alleviating the instability issue in the GAN training procedure via new architecture design. The discrepancy between the minimax and maximin objective values could serve as a proxy for the difficulties that the alternating gradient descent encounters in the optimization of GANs. In this work, we give new results on the benefits of multi-generator architecture of GANs. We show that the minimax gap shrinks to \\epsilon as the number of generators increases with rate O(1/\\epsilon). This improves over the best-known result of O(1/\\epsilon^2). At the core of our techniques is a novel application of Shapley-Folkman lemma to the generic minimax problem, where in the literature the technique was only known to work when the objective function is restricted to the Lagrangian function of a constraint optimization problem. Our proposed Stackelberg GAN performs well experimentally in both synthetic and real-world datasets, improving Frechet Inception Distance by 14.61% over the previous multi-generator GANs on the benchmark datasets.",

To resolve this problem, we propose precision highway, which forms an end-to-end high-precision information flow while performing the ultra-low-precision computation. First, we describe how the precision highway reduce the accumulated quantization error in both convolutional and recurrent neural networks. We also provide the quantitative analysis of the benefit of precision highway and evaluate the overhead on the state-of-the-art hardware accelerator. In the experiments, our proposed method outperforms the best existing quantization methods while offering 3-bit weight/activation quantization with no accuracy loss and 2-bit quantization with a 2.45 % top-1 accuracy loss in ResNet-50. We also report that the proposed method significantly outperforms the existing method in the 2-bit quantization of an LSTM for language modeling.",

    "abstract": "Intelligent creatures can explore their environments and learn useful skills without supervision.\nIn this paper, we propose ``Diversity is All You Need''(DIAYN), a method for learning useful skills without a reward function. Our proposed method learns skills by maximizing an information theoretic objective using a maximum entropy policy. On a variety of simulated robotic tasks, we show that this simple objective results in the unsupervised emergence of diverse skills, such as walking and jumping. In a number of reinforcement learning benchmark environments, our method is able to learn a skill that solves the benchmark task despite never receiving the true task reward. We show how pretrained skills can provide a good parameter initialization for downstream tasks, and can be composed hierarchically to solve complex, sparse reward tasks. Our results suggest that unsupervised discovery of skills can serve as an effective pretraining mechanism for overcoming challenges of exploration and data efficiency in reinforcement learning.",

    "title": "HAPPIER: Hierarchical Polyphonic Music Generative RNN",
    "abstract": "Generating polyphonic music with coherent global structure is a major challenge for automatic composition algorithms. The primary difficulty arises due to the inefficiency of models to recognize underlying patterns beneath music notes across different levels of time scales and remain long-term consistency while composing. Hierarchical architectures can capture and represent learned patterns in different temporal scales and maintain consistency over long time spans, and this corresponds to the hierarchical structure in music. Motivated by this, focusing on leveraging the idea of hierarchical models and improve them to fit the sequence modeling problem, our paper proposes HAPPIER: a novel HierArchical PolyPhonic musIc gEnerative RNN. In HAPPIER, A higher `measure level' learns correlations across measures and patterns for chord progressions, and a lower `note level' learns a conditional distribution over the notes to generate within a measure. The two hierarchies operate at different clock rates: the higher one operates on a longer timescale and updates every measure, while the lower one operates on a shorter timescale and updates every unit duration. The two levels communicate with each other, and thus the entire architecture is trained jointly end-to-end by back-propagation. HAPPIER, profited from the strength of the hierarchical structure, generates polyphonic music with long-term dependencies compared to the state-of-the-art methods.",

    "abstract": "Bottleneck structures with identity (e.g., residual) connection are now emerging popular paradigms for designing deep convolutional neural networks (CNN), for processing large-scale features efficiently. In this paper, we focus on the information-preserving nature of identity connection and utilize this to enable a convolutional layer to have a new functionality of channel-selectivity, i.e., re-distributing its computations to important channels. In particular, we propose Selective Convolutional Unit (SCU), a widely-applicable architectural unit that improves parameter efficiency of various modern CNNs with bottlenecks. During training, SCU gradually learns the channel-selectivity on-the-fly via the alternative usage of (a) pruning unimportant channels, and (b) rewiring the pruned parameters to important channels. The rewired parameters emphasize the target channel in a way that selectively enlarges the convolutional kernels corresponding to it. Our experimental results demonstrate that the SCU-based models without any postprocessing generally achieve both model compression and accuracy improvement compared to the baselines, consistently for all tested architectures.",

    "abstract": "Communication on heterogeneous edge networks is a fundamental bottleneck in Federated Learning (FL), restricting both model capacity and user participation. To address this issue, we introduce two novel strategies to reduce communication costs: (1) the use of lossy compression on the global model sent server-to-client; and (2) Federated Dropout, which allows users to efficiently train locally on smaller subsets of the global model and also provides a reduction in both client-to-server communication and local computation. We empirically show that these strategies, combined with existing compression approaches for client-to-server communication, collectively provide up to a 9.6x reduction in server-to-client communication, a 1.5x reduction in local computation, and a 24x reduction in upload communication, all without degrading the quality of the final model. We thus comprehensively reduce FL's impact on client device resources, allowing higher capacity models to be trained, and a more diverse set of users to be reached.",

    "title": "Learning with Reflective Likelihoods",
    "abstract": "Models parameterized by deep neural networks have achieved state-of-the-art results  in  many  domains.  These  models  are  usually  trained  using  the  maximum likelihood principle with a finite set of observations. However, training deep probabilistic models with maximum likelihood can lead to the issue we refer to as input forgetting. In deep generative latent-variable models, input forgetting corresponds to posterior collapse---a phenomenon in which the latent variables are driven independent from the observations. However input forgetting can happen even in the absence of latent variables.  We attribute input forgetting in deep probabilistic models to the finite sample dilemma of maximum likelihood.  We formalize this problem and propose a learning criterion---termed reflective likelihood---that explicitly prevents input forgetting. We empirically observe that the proposed criterion significantly outperforms the maximum likelihood objective when used in classification under a skewed class distribution.  Furthermore, the reflective likelihood objective prevents posterior collapse when used to train stochastic auto-encoders with amortized inference.  For example in a neural topic modeling experiment, the reflective likelihood objective leads to better quantitative and qualitative results than the variational auto-encoder and the importance-weighted auto-encoder.",

    "abstract": "Positive Unlabeled (PU) learning consists in learning to distinguish samples of our class of interest, the positive class, from the counter-examples, the negative class, by using positive labeled and unlabeled samples during the training. Recent approaches exploit the GANs abilities to address the PU learning problem by generating relevant counter-examples. In this paper, we propose a new GAN-based PU learning approach named Divergent-GAN (D-GAN). The key idea is to incorporate a standard Positive Unlabeled learning risk inside the GAN discriminator loss function. In this way, the discriminator can ask the generator to converge towards the unlabeled samples distribution while diverging from the positive samples distribution. This enables the generator convergence towards the unlabeled counter-examples distribution without using prior knowledge, while keeping the standard adversarial GAN architecture. In addition, we discuss normalization techniques in the context of the proposed framework. Experimental results show that the proposed approach overcomes previous GAN-based PU learning methods issues, and it globally outperforms two-stage state of the art PU learning performances in terms of stability and prediction on both simple and complex image datasets.",

    "title": "Interactive Agent Modeling by Learning to Probe",
    "abstract": "The ability of modeling the other agents, such as understanding their intentions and skills, is essential to an agent's interactions with other agents. Conventional agent modeling relies on passive observation from demonstrations. In this work, we propose an interactive agent modeling scheme enabled by encouraging an agent to learn to probe. In particular, the probing agent (i.e. a learner) learns to interact with the environment and with a target agent (i.e., a demonstrator) to maximize the change in the observed behaviors of that agent. Through probing, rich behaviors can be observed and are used for enhancing the agent modeling to learn a more accurate mind model of the target agent. Our framework consists of two learning processes: i) imitation learning for an approximated agent model and ii) pure curiosity-driven reinforcement learning for an efficient probing policy to discover new behaviors that otherwise can not be observed. We have validated our approach in four different tasks. The experimental results suggest that the agent model learned by our approach i) generalizes better in novel scenarios than the ones learned by passive observation, random probing, and other curiosity-driven approaches do, and ii) can be used for enhancing performance in multiple applications including distilling optimal planning to a policy net, collaboration, and competition.

    "title": "Prob2Vec: Mathematical Semantic Embedding for Problem Retrieval in Adaptive Tutoring",
    "abstract": "We propose a new application of embedding techniques to problem retrieval in adaptive tutoring. The objective is to retrieve problems similar in mathematical concepts. There are two challenges: First, like sentences, problems helpful to tutoring are never exactly the same in terms of the underlying concepts. Instead, good problems mix concepts in innovative ways, while still displaying continuity in their relationships. Second, it is difficult for humans to determine a similarity score consistent across a large enough training set. We propose a hierarchical problem embedding algorithm, called Prob2Vec, that consists of an abstraction and an embedding step. Prob2Vec achieves 96.88\\% accuracy on a problem similarity test, in contrast to 75\\% from directly applying state-of-the-art sentence embedding methods. It is surprising that Prob2Vec is able to distinguish very fine-grained differences among problems, an ability humans need time and effort to acquire. In addition, the sub-problem of concept labeling with imbalanced training data set is interesting in its own right. It is a multi-label problem suffering from dimensionality explosion, which we propose ways to ameliorate. We propose the novel negative pre-training algorithm that dramatically reduces false negative and positive ratios for classification, using an imbalanced training data set.",

    "abstract": "Interpretability has largely focused on local explanations, i.e. explaining why a model made a particular prediction for a sample. These explanations are appealing due to their simplicity and local fidelity. However, they do not provide information about the general behavior of the model. We propose to leverage model distillation to learn global additive explanations that describe the relationship between input features and model predictions. These global explanations take the form of feature shapes, which are more expressive than feature attributions. Through careful experimentation, we show qualitatively and quantitatively that global additive explanations are able to describe model behavior and yield insights about models such as neural nets. A visualization of our approach applied to a neural net as it is trained is available at https://youtu.be/ErQYwNqzEdc",

    "title": "ReNeg and Backseat Driver: Learning from demonstration with continuous human feedback",
    "abstract": "Reinforcement learning (RL) is a powerful framework for solving problems by exploring and learning from mistakes. However, in the context of autonomous vehicle (AV) control, requiring an agent to make mistakes, or even allowing mistakes, can be quite dangerous and costly in the real world. For this reason, AV RL is generally only viable in simulation. Because these simulations have imperfect representations, particularly with respect to graphics, physics, and human interaction, we find motivation for a framework similar to RL, suitable to the real world. To this end, we formulate a learning framework that learns from restricted exploration by having a human demonstrator do the exploration. Existing work on learning from demonstration typically either assumes the collected data is performed by an optimal expert, or requires potentially dangerous exploration to find the optimal policy. We propose an alternative framework that learns continuous control from only safe behavior. One of our key insights is that the problem becomes tractable if the feedback score that rates the demonstration applies to the atomic action, as opposed to the entire sequence of actions. We use human experts to collect driving data as well as to label the driving data through a framework we call ``Backseat Driver'', giving us state-action pairs matched with scalar values representing the score for the action. We call the more general learning framework ReNeg, since it learns a regression from states to actions given negative as well as positive examples. We empirically validate several models in the ReNeg framework, testing on lane-following with limited data. We find that the best solution in this context outperforms behavioral cloning has strong connections to stochastic policy gradient approaches.",

Traditional approaches firstly detect topic entity mentioned in questions, then traverse the knowledge graph to find relations as a multi-hop path to answers, while we propose a novel approach to leverage simple-question answerers to answer compound questions. Our model consists of two parts: (i) a novel learning-to-decompose agent that learns a policy to decompose a compound question into simple questions and (ii) three independent simple-question answerers that classify the corresponding relations for each simple question. Experiments demonstrate that our model learns complex rules of compositionality as stochastic policy, which benefits simple neural networks to achieve state-of-the-art results on WebQuestions and MetaQA. We analyze the interpretable decomposition process as well as generated partitions.",

    "abstract": "Many machine learning image classifiers are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, inputs with perturbations designed to intentionally trigger misclassification. Current adversarial methods directly alter pixel colors and evaluate against pixel norm-balls: pixel perturbations smaller than a specified magnitude, according to a measurement norm. This evaluation, however, has limited practical utility since perturbations in the pixel space do not correspond to underlying real-world phenomena of image formation that lead to them and has no security motivation attached. Pixels in natural images are measurements of light that has interacted with the geometry of a physical scene. As such, we propose a novel evaluation measure, parametric norm-balls, by directly perturbing physical parameters that underly image formation. One enabling contribution we present is a physically-based differentiable renderer that allows us to propagate pixel gradients to the parametric space of lighting and geometry. Our approach enables physically-based adversarial attacks, and our differentiable renderer leverages models from the interactive rendering literature to balance the performance and accuracy trade-offs necessary for a memory-efficient and scalable adversarial data augmentation workflow.",

    "title": "The Unusual Effectiveness of Averaging in GAN Training",
    "abstract": "We examine two different techniques for parameter averaging in GAN training. Moving Average (MA) computes the time-average of parameters, whereas Exponential Moving Average (EMA) computes an exponentially discounted sum. Whilst MA is known to lead to convergence in bilinear settings, we provide the -- to our knowledge -- first theoretical arguments in support of EMA. We show that EMA converges to limit cycles around the equilibrium with vanishing amplitude as the discount parameter approaches one for simple bilinear games and also enhances the stability of general GAN training. We establish experimentally that both techniques are strikingly effective in the non-convex-concave GAN setting as well. Both improve inception and FID scores on different architectures and for different GAN objectives. We provide comprehensive experimental results across a range of datasets -- mixture of Gaussians, CIFAR-10, STL-10, CelebA and ImageNet -- to demonstrate its effectiveness. We achieve state-of-the-art results on CIFAR-10 and produce clean CelebA face images.\\footnote{~The code is available at \\url{https://github.com/yasinyazici/EMA_GAN}}",

    "abstract": "We propose a method for learning the dependency structure between latent variables in deep latent variable models.  Our general modeling and inference framework combines the complementary strengths of deep generative models and probabilistic graphical models. In particular, we express the latent variable space of a variational autoencoder (VAE) in terms of a Bayesian network with a learned, flexible dependency structure.  The network parameters, variational parameters as well as the latent topology are optimized simultaneously with a single objective.  Inference is formulated via a sampling procedure that produces expectations over latent variable structures and incorporates top-down and bottom-up reasoning over latent variable values.  We validate our framework in extensive experiments on MNIST, Omniglot, and CIFAR-10. Comparisons to state-of-the-art structured variational autoencoder baselines show improvements in terms of the expressiveness of the learned model.",

    "title": "Learning and Planning with a Semantic Model",
    "abstract": "Building deep reinforcement learning agents that can generalize and adapt to unseen environments remains a fundamental challenge for AI. This paper describes progresses on this challenge in the context of man-made environments, which are visually diverse but contain intrinsic semantic regularities. We propose a hybrid model-based and model-free approach, LEArning and Planning with Semantics (LEAPS), consisting of a multi-target sub-policy that acts on visual inputs, and a Bayesian model over semantic structures. When placed in an unseen environment, the agent plans with the semantic model to make high-level decisions, proposes the next sub-target for the sub-policy to execute, and updates the semantic model based on new observations. We perform experiments in visual navigation tasks using House3D, a 3D environment that contains diverse human-designed indoor scenes with real-world objects. LEAPS outperforms strong baselines that do not explicitly plan using the semantic content.",

    "abstract": "For semantic image segmentation and lane detection, nets with a single spatial pyramid structure or encoder-decoder structure are usually exploited. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) show great results on both high-level and low-level features representations, however, the capability has not been fully embodied for lane detection task. In especial, it's still a challenge for model-based lane detection to combine the multi-scale context with a pixel-level accuracy because of the weak visual appearance and strong prior information. In this paper, we we propose an novel network for lane detection, the three main contributions are as follows. First, we employ multiple encoder-decoders module in end-to-end ways and show the promising results for lane detection. Second, we analysis different configurations of multiple encoder-decoders nets. Third, we make our attempts to rethink the evaluation methods of lane detection for the limitation of the popular methods based on IoU.",

Our experimental results confirm that the perceptor gradients algorithm is able to efficiently learn transferable symbolic representations as well as generate new observations according to a semantically meaningful specification.\n",

    "abstract": "Conventional reinforcement learning rarely considers how the physical variations in the environment (eg. mass, drag, etc.) affect the policy learned by the agent. In this paper, we explore how changes in the environment affect  policy generalization. We observe experimentally that, for each task we considered, there exists an optimal environment setting that results in the most robust policy that generalizes well to future environments. We propose a novel method to exploit this observation to develop robust actor policies, by automatically developing a sampling curriculum over environment settings to use in training. Ours is a model-free approach and experiments demonstrate that the performance of our method is on par with the best policies found by an exhaustive grid search, while bearing a significantly lower computational cost.",

    "abstract": "We investigate a variant of variational autoencoders where there is a superstructure of discrete latent variables on top of the latent features. In general, our superstructure is a tree structure of multiple super latent variables and it is automatically learned from data. When there is only one latent variable in the superstructure, our model reduces to one that assumes the latent features to be generated from a Gaussian mixture model. We call our model the latent tree variational autoencoder (LTVAE). Whereas previous deep learning methods for clustering produce only one partition of data, LTVAE produces multiple partitions of data, each being given by one super latent variable. This is desirable because high dimensional data usually have many different natural facets and can be meaningfully partitioned in multiple ways.",

In particular, we learn a camouflage pattern to hide vehicles from being detected by state-of-the-art convolutional neural network based detectors. Our approach alternates between two threads. In the first, we train a neural approximation function to imitate how a simulator applies a camouflage to vehicles and how a vehicle detector performs given images of the camouflaged vehicles. In the second, we minimize the approximated detection score by searching for the optimal camouflage. Experiments show that the learned camouflage can not only hide a vehicle from the image-based detectors under many test cases but also generalizes to different environments, vehicles, and object detectors.",

In this paper, we attack this problem from a modelling approach, where we perform thorough theoretical analysis on BN applied to simplified model: ordinary least squares (OLS). We discover that gradient descent on OLS with BN has interesting properties, including a scaling law, convergence for arbitrary learning rates for the weights, asymptotic acceleration effects, as well as insensitivity to choice of learning rates. We then demonstrate numerically that these findings are not specific to the OLS problem and hold qualitatively for more complex supervised learning problems. This points to a new direction towards uncovering the mathematical principles that underlies batch normalization.",

    "title": "NEURAL MALWARE CONTROL WITH DEEP REINFORCEMENT LEARNING",
    "abstract": "Antimalware products are a key component in detecting malware attacks, and their engines typically execute unknown programs in a sandbox prior to running them on the native operating system. Files cannot be scanned indefinitely so the engine employs heuristics to determine when to halt execution. Previous research has investigated analyzing the sequence of system calls generated during this emulation process to predict if an unknown file is malicious, but these models require the emulation to be stopped after executing a fixed number of events from the beginning of the file. Also, these classifiers are not accurate enough to halt emulation in the middle of the file on their own. In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm which overcomes this limitation and learns the best time to halt the file's execution based on deep reinforcement learning (DRL). Because the new DRL-based system continues to emulate the unknown file until it can make a confident decision to stop, it prevents attackers from avoiding detection by initiating malicious activity after a fixed number of system calls. Results show that the proposed malware execution control model automatically halts emulation for 91.3\\% of the files earlier than heuristics employed by the engine. Furthermore, classifying the files at that time improves the true positive rate by 61.5%, at a false positive rate of 1%, compared to a baseline classifier.",

    "abstract": "To educate hyper deep learners, \\emph{Curriculum Learnings} (CLs) require either human heuristic participation or self-deciding the difficulties of training instances. These coaching manners are blind to the coherent structures among examples, categories, and tasks, which are pregnant with more knowledgeable curriculum-routed teachers. In this paper, we propose a general methodology \\emph{Teaching to Teach} (T2T). T2T is facilitated by \\emph{Structured Dark Knowledge} (SDK) that constitutes a communication protocol between structured knowledge prior and teaching strategies. On one hand, SDK adaptively extracts structured knowledge by selecting a training subset consistent with the previous teaching decisions. On the other hand, SDK teaches curriculum-agnostic teachers by transferring this knowledge to update their teaching policy. This virtuous cycle can be flexibly-deployed in most existing CL platforms and more importantly, very generic across various structured knowledge characteristics, e.g., diversity, complementarity, and causality. We evaluate T2T across different learners, teachers, and tasks, which significantly demonstrates that structured knowledge can be inherited by the teachers to further benefit learners' training.\n",

    "title": "Bias-Reduced Uncertainty Estimation for Deep Neural Classifiers",
    "abstract": "We consider the problem of uncertainty estimation in the context of (non-Bayesian) deep neural classification. In this context, all known methods are based on extracting uncertainty signals from a trained network optimized to solve the classification problem at hand. We demonstrate that such techniques tend to introduce biased estimates for instances whose predictions are supposed to be highly confident. We argue that this deficiency is an artifact of the dynamics of training with SGD-like optimizers, and it has some properties similar to overfitting. Based on this observation, we develop an uncertainty estimation algorithm that selectively estimates the uncertainty of highly confident points, using earlier snapshots of the trained model, before their estimates are jittered (and way before they are ready for actual classification). We present extensive experiments indicating that the proposed algorithm provides uncertainty estimates that are consistently better than all known methods.",

    "abstract": "Driven by the need for parallelizable hyperparameter optimization methods, this paper studies open loop search methods: sequences that are predetermined and can be generated before a single configuration is evaluated. Examples include grid search, uniform random search, low discrepancy sequences, and other sampling distributions.\nIn particular, we propose the use of k-determinantal point processes in  hyperparameter optimization via random search. Compared to conventional uniform random search where hyperparameter settings are sampled independently, a k-DPP promotes diversity.  We describe an approach that transforms hyperparameter search spaces for efficient use with a k-DPP. In addition, we introduce a novel Metropolis-Hastings algorithm which can sample from k-DPPs defined over any space from which uniform samples can be drawn, including spaces with a mixture of discrete and continuous dimensions or tree structure. Our experiments show significant benefits  in realistic scenarios with a limited budget for training supervised learners, whether in serial or parallel.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we propose a new control framework called the moving endpoint control to restore images corrupted by different degradation levels in one model. The proposed control problem contains a restoration dynamics which is modeled by an RNN. The moving endpoint, which is essentially the terminal time of the associated dynamics, is determined by a policy network. We call the proposed model the dynamically unfolding recurrent restorer (DURR). Numerical experiments show that DURR is able to achieve state-of-the-art performances on blind image denoising and JPEG image deblocking. Furthermore, DURR can well generalize to images with higher degradation levels that are not included in the training stage.",

    "title": "ACCELERATING NONCONVEX LEARNING VIA REPLICA EXCHANGE LANGEVIN DIFFUSION",
    "abstract": "Langevin diffusion is a powerful method for nonconvex optimization, which enables the escape from local minima by injecting noise into the gradient. In particular, the temperature parameter controlling the noise level gives rise to a tradeoff between ``global exploration'' and ``local exploitation'', which correspond to high and low temperatures. To attain the advantages of both regimes, we propose to use replica exchange, which swaps between two Langevin diffusions with different temperatures. We theoretically analyze the acceleration effect of replica exchange from two perspectives: (i) the convergence in $\\chi^2$-divergence, and (ii) the large deviation principle. Such an acceleration effect allows us to faster approach the global minima. Furthermore, by discretizing the replica exchange Langevin diffusion, we obtain a discrete-time algorithm. For such an algorithm, we quantify its discretization error in theory and demonstrate its acceleration effect in practice. ",

    "abstract": "Deep neural networks (DNN) are widely used in many applications. However, their deployment on edge devices has been difficult because they are resource hungry. Binary neural networks (BNN) help to alleviate the prohibitive resource requirements of DNN, where both activations and weights are limited to 1-bit. We propose an improved binary training method (BNN+), by introducing a regularization function that encourages training weights around binary values. In addition to this, to enhance model performance we add trainable scaling factors to our regularization functions. Furthermore, we use an improved approximation of the derivative of the sign activation function in the backward computation. These additions are based on linear operations that are easily implementable into the binary training framework. We show experimental results on CIFAR-10 obtaining an accuracy of 86.5%, on AlexNet and 91.3% with VGG network. On ImageNet, our method also outperforms the traditional BNN method and XNOR-net, using AlexNet by a margin of 4% and 2% top-1 accuracy respectively.",

    "abstract": "Various architectural advancements in the design of recurrent neural networks~(RNN) have been focusing on improving the empirical stability and representability by sacrificing the complexity of the architecture. However, more remains to be done to fully understand the fundamental trade-off between these conflicting requirements. Towards answering this question, we forsake the purely bottom-up approach of data-driven machine learning to understand, instead,  the physical origin and dynamical properties of existing RNN architectures.  This facilitates designing new RNNs with smaller complexity overhead and provable stability guarantee. First, we define a family of  deep recurrent neural networks,  $n$-$t$-ORNN, according to the order of nonlinearity $n$ and the range of temporal memory scale $t$ in their underlying dynamics embodied in the form of discretized ordinary differential equations. We show that most of the existing proposals of RNN architectures belong to different orders of $n$-$t$-ORNNs.    We then propose a new RNN ansatz, namely the Quantum-inspired  Universal computing  Neural Network~(QUNN), to leverage the reversibility, stability, and universality of quantum computation for stable and universal RNN.  QUNN   provides a complexity reduction in the number of training parameters from being polynomial in both data and correlation time to only linear in correlation time.  Compared to Long-Short-Term Memory (LSTM), QUNN of the same number of hidden layers facilitates higher nonlinearity and longer memory span with provable stability. Our work opens new directions in designing minimal RNNs based on additional knowledge about the dynamical nature of both the data and different training architectures.",

    "abstract": "Learning at small or large scales of data is addressed by two strong but divided frontiers: few-shot learning and standard supervised learning. Few-shot learning focuses on sample efficiency at small scale, while supervised learning focuses on accuracy at large scale. Ideally they could be reconciled for effective learning at any number of data points (shot) and number of classes (way). To span the full spectrum of shot and way, we frame the variadic learning regime of learning from any number of inputs. We approach variadic learning by meta-learning a novel multi-modal clustering model that connects bayesian nonparametrics and deep metric learning. Our bayesian nonparametric deep embedding (BANDE) method is optimized end-to-end with a single objective, and adaptively adjusts capacity to learn from variable amounts of supervision. We show that multi-modality is critical for learning complex classes such as Omniglot alphabets and carrying out unsupervised clustering. We explore variadic learning by measuring generalization across shot and way between meta-train and meta-test, show the first results for scaling from few-way, few-shot tasks to 1692-way Omniglot classification and 5k-shot CIFAR-10 classification, and find that nonparametric methods generalize better than parametric methods. On the standard few-shot learning benchmarks of Omniglot and mini-ImageNet, BANDE equals or improves on the state-of-the-art for semi-supervised classification.",

    "abstract": "With interest in program synthesis and similarly ﬂavored problems rapidly increasing, neural models optimized for tree-domain problems are of great value. In the sequence domain, transformers can learn relationships across arbitrary pairs of positions with less bias than recurrent models. Under the intuition that a similar property would be beneficial in the tree domain, we propose a method to extend transformers to tree-structured inputs and/or outputs. Our approach abstracts transformer's default sinusoidal positional encodings, allowing us to substitute in a novel custom positional encoding scheme that represents node positions within a tree. We evaluated our model in tree-to-tree program translation and sequence-to-tree semantic parsing settings, achieving superior performance over the vanilla transformer model on several tasks.\n",

    "abstract": "Most classifiers operate by selecting the maximum of an estimate of the conditional distribution $p(y|x)$ where $x$ stands for the features of the instance to be classified and $y$ denotes its label. This often results in a hubristic bias: overconfidence in the assignment of a definite label. Usually, the observations are concentrated on a small volume but the classifier provides definite predictions for the entire space. We propose constructing conformal prediction sets which contain a set of labels rather than a single label. These conformal prediction sets contain the true label with probability $1-\\alpha$. Our construction is based on $p(x|y)$ rather than $p(y|x)$ which results in a classifier that is very cautious: it outputs the null set --- meaning ``I don't know'' --- when the object does not resemble the training examples. An important property of our approach is that classes can be added or removed without having to retrain the classifier. We demonstrate the performance on the ImageNet ILSVRC dataset and the CelebA and IMDB-Wiki facial datasets using high dimensional features obtained from state of the art convolutional neural networks.

    "title": "Detecting Adversarial Examples Via Neural Fingerprinting",
    "abstract": "Deep neural networks are vulnerable to adversarial examples: input data that has been manipulated to cause dramatic model output errors. To defend against such attacks, we propose NeuralFingerprinting: a simple, yet effective method to detect adversarial examples that verifies whether model behavior is consistent with a set of fingerprints. These fingerprints are encoded into the model response during training and are inspired by the use of biometric and cryptographic signatures. In contrast to previous defenses, our method does not rely on knowledge of the adversary and can scale to large networks and input data. The benefits of our method are that 1) it is fast, 2) it is prohibitively expensive for an attacker to reverse-engineer which fingerprints were used, and 3) it does not assume knowledge of the adversary. In this work, we 1) theoretically analyze NeuralFingerprinting for linear models and 2) show that NeuralFingerprinting significantly improves on state-of-the-art detection mechanisms for deep neural networks, by detecting the strongest known adversarial attacks with 98-100% AUC-ROC scores on the MNIST, CIFAR-10 and MiniImagenet (20 classes) datasets.  In particular, we consider several threat models, including the most conservative one in which the attacker has full knowledge of the defender's strategy. In all settings, the detection accuracy of NeuralFingerprinting generalizes well to unseen test-data and is robust over a wide range of hyperparameters.",

    "title": "Learning Localized Generative Models for 3D Point Clouds via Graph Convolution",
    "abstract": "Point clouds are an important type of geometric data and have widespread use in computer graphics and vision. However, learning representations for point clouds is particularly challenging due to their nature as being an unordered collection of points irregularly distributed in 3D space. Graph convolution, a generalization of the convolution operation for data defined over graphs, has been recently shown to be very successful at extracting localized features from point clouds in supervised or semi-supervised tasks such as classification or segmentation. This paper studies the unsupervised problem of a generative model exploiting graph convolution. We focus on the generator of a GAN and define methods for graph convolution when the graph is not known in advance as it is the very output of the generator. The proposed architecture learns to generate localized features that approximate graph embeddings of the output geometry. We also study the problem of defining an upsampling layer in the graph-convolutional generator, such that it learns to exploit a self-similarity prior on the data distribution to sample more effectively.",

    "abstract": "Online and stochastic optimization methods such as SGD, ADAGRAD and ADAM are key algorithms in solving large-scale machine learning problems including deep learning. A number of schemes that are based on communications of nodes with a central server have been recently proposed in the literature to parallelize them. A bottleneck of such centralized algorithms lies on the high communication cost incurred by the central node. In this paper, we present a new consensus-based distributed adaptive moment estimation method (DADAM) for online optimization over a decentralized network that enables data parallelization, as well as decentralized computation. Such a framework note only can be extremely useful for learning agents with access to only local data in a communication constrained environment, but as shown in this work also outperform centralized adaptive algorithms such as ADAM for certain realistic classes of loss functions. We analyze the convergence properties of the proposed algorithm and provide a \\textit{dynamic regret} bound on the convergence rate of adaptive moment estimation methods in both stochastic and deterministic settings. Empirical results demonstrate that DADAM works well in practice and compares favorably to competing online optimization methods.",

    "abstract": "Similar to models of brain-like computation, artificial deep neural networks rely\non distributed coding, parallel processing and plastic synaptic weights. Training\ndeep neural networks with the error-backpropagation algorithm, however, is\nconsidered bio-implausible. An appealing alternative to training deep neural networks\nis to use one or a few hidden layers with fixed random weights or trained\nwith an unsupervised, local learning rule and train a single readout layer with a\nsupervised, local learning rule. We find that a network of leaky-integrate-andfire\nneurons with fixed random, localized receptive fields in the hidden layer and\nspike timing dependent plasticity to train the readout layer achieves 98.1% test\naccuracy on MNIST, which is close to the optimal result achievable with error-backpropagation\nin non-convolutional networks of rate neurons with one hidden\nlayer. To support the design choices of the spiking network, we systematically\ncompare the classification performance of rate networks with a single hidden\nlayer, where the weights of this layer are either random and fixed, trained with\nunsupervised Principal Component Analysis or Sparse Coding, or trained with\nthe backpropagation algorithm. This comparison revealed, first, that unsupervised\nlearning does not lead to better performance than fixed random projections for\nlarge hidden layers on digit classification (MNIST) and object recognition (CIFAR10);\nsecond, networks with random projections and localized receptive fields\nperform significantly better than networks with all-to-all connectivity and almost\nreach the performance of networks trained with the backpropagation algorithm.\nThe performance of these simple random projection networks is comparable to\nmost current models of bio-plausible deep learning and thus provides an interesting\nbenchmark for future approaches.",

    "abstract": "Random Matrix Theory (RMT) is applied to analyze the weight matrices of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs), including both production quality, pre-trained models such as AlexNet and Inception, and smaller models trained from scratch, such as LeNet5 and a miniature-AlexNet.  Empirical and theoretical results clearly indicate that the empirical spectral density (ESD) of DNN layer matrices displays signatures of traditionally-regularized statistical models, even in the absence of exogenously specifying traditional forms of regularization, such as Dropout or Weight Norm constraints.  Building on recent results in RMT, most notably its extension to Universality classes of Heavy-Tailed matrices, we develop a theory to identify 5+1 Phases of Training, corresponding to increasing amounts of Implicit Self-Regularization.  For smaller and/or older DNNs, this Implicit Self-Regularization is like traditional Tikhonov regularization, in that there is a \"size scale\" separating signal from noise.  For state-of-the-art DNNs, however, we identify a novel form of Heavy-Tailed Self-Regularization, similar to the self-organization seen in the statistical physics of disordered systems.  This implicit Self-Regularization can depend strongly on the many knobs of the training process.  By exploiting the generalization gap phenomena, we demonstrate that we can cause a small model to exhibit all 5+1 phases of training simply by changing the batch size.",

    "abstract": "Compression is a key step to deploy large neural networks on resource-constrained platforms. As a popular compression technique, quantization constrains the number of distinct weight values and thus reducing the number of bits required to represent and store each weight. In this paper, we study the representation power of quantized neural networks. First, we prove the universal approximability of quantized ReLU networks on a wide class of functions. Then we provide upper bounds on the number of weights and the memory size for a given approximation error bound and the bit-width of weights for function-independent and function-dependent structures. Our results reveal that, to attain an approximation error bound of $\\epsilon$, the number of weights needed by a quantized network is no more than $\\mathcal{O}\\left(\\log^5(1/\\epsilon)\\right)$ times that of an unquantized network. This overhead is of much lower order than the lower bound of the number of weights needed for the error bound, supporting the empirical success of various quantization techniques. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first in-depth study on the complexity bounds of quantized neural networks.",

    "title": "Dynamic Early Terminating of Multiply Accumulate Operations for Saving Computation Cost in Convolutional Neural Networks",
    "abstract": "Deep learning has been attracting enormous attention from academia as well as industry due to its great success in many artificial intelligence applications. As more applications are developed, the need for implementing a complex neural network model on an energy-limited edge device becomes more critical. To this end, this paper proposes a new optimization method to reduce the computation efforts of convolutional neural networks. The method takes advantage of the fact that some convolutional operations are actually wasteful since their outputs are pruned by the following activation or pooling layers. Basically, a convolutional filter conducts a series of multiply-accumulate (MAC) operations. We propose to set a checkpoint in the MAC process to determine whether a filter could terminate early based on the intermediate result. Furthermore, a fine-tuning process is conducted to recover the accuracy drop due to the applied checkpoints. The experimental results show that the proposed method can save approximately 50% MAC operations with less than 1% accuracy drop for CIFAR-10 example model and Network in Network on the CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets. Additionally, compared with the state-of- the-art method, the proposed method is more effective on the CIFAR-10 dataset and is competitive on the CIFAR-100 dataset.",

    "title": "LEARNING FACTORIZED REPRESENTATIONS FOR OPEN-SET DOMAIN ADAPTATION",
    "abstract": "Domain adaptation for visual recognition has undergone great progress in the past few years. Nevertheless, most existing methods work in the so-called closed-set scenario, assuming that the classes depicted by the target images are exactly the same as those of the source domain. In this paper, we tackle the more challenging, yet more realistic case of open-set domain adaptation, where new, unknown classes can be present in the target data. While, in the unsupervised scenario, one cannot expect to be able to identify each specific new class, we aim to automatically detect which samples belong to these new classes and discard them from the recognition process. To this end, we rely on the intuition that the source and target samples depicting the known classes can be generated by a shared subspace, whereas the target samples from unknown classes come from a different, private subspace. We therefore introduce a framework that factorizes the data into shared and private parts, while encouraging the shared representation to be discriminative. Our experiments on standard benchmarks evidence that our approach significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art in open-set domain adaptation.",

    "abstract": "It is clear that users should own and control their data and privacy. Utility providers are also becoming more interested in guaranteeing data privacy. Therefore, users and providers can and should collaborate in privacy protecting challenges, and this paper addresses this new paradigm. We propose a framework where the user controls what characteristics of the data they want to share (utility) and what they want to keep private (secret), without necessarily asking the utility provider to change its existing machine learning algorithms. We first analyze the space of privacy-preserving representations and derive natural information-theoretic bounds on the utility-privacy trade-off when disclosing a sanitized version of the data X. We present explicit learning architectures to learn privacy-preserving representations that approach this bound in a data-driven fashion. We describe important use-case scenarios where the utility providers are willing to collaborate with the sanitization process. We study space-preserving transformations where the utility provider can use the same algorithm on original and sanitized data, a critical and novel attribute to help service providers accommodate varying privacy requirements with a single set of utility algorithms. We illustrate this framework through  the implementation of three use cases; subject-within-subject, where we tackle the problem of having a face identity detector that works only on a consenting subset of users, an important application, for example, for mobile devices activated by face recognition; gender-and-subject, where we preserve facial verification while hiding the gender attribute for users who choose to do so; and emotion-and-gender, where we hide independent variables, as is the case of hiding gender while preserving emotion detection.",

    "title": "Variational Bayesian Phylogenetic Inference",
    "abstract": "Bayesian phylogenetic inference is currently done via Markov chain Monte Carlo with simple mechanisms for proposing new states, which hinders exploration efficiency and often requires long runs to deliver accurate posterior estimates. In this paper we present an alternative approach: a variational framework for Bayesian phylogenetic analysis. We approximate the true posterior using an expressive graphical model for tree distributions, called a subsplit Bayesian network, together with appropriate branch length distributions. We train the variational approximation via stochastic gradient ascent and adopt multi-sample based gradient estimators for different latent variables separately to handle the composite latent space of phylogenetic models. We show that our structured variational approximations are flexible enough to provide comparable posterior estimation to MCMC, while requiring less computation due to a more efficient tree exploration mechanism enabled by variational inference. Moreover, the variational approximations can be readily used for further statistical analysis such as marginal likelihood estimation for model comparison via importance sampling. Experiments on both synthetic data and real data Bayesian phylogenetic inference problems demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our methods.",

    "abstract": "Many works have been proposed in the literature to capture the dynamics of diffusion in networks. While some of them define graphical markovian models to extract temporal relationships between node infections in networks, others consider diffusion episodes as sequences of infections via recurrent neural models. In this paper we propose a model at the crossroads of these two extremes, which embeds the history of diffusion in infected nodes as hidden continuous states. Depending on the trajectory followed by the content before reaching a given node, the distribution of influence probabilities may vary. However, content trajectories  are usually hidden in the data, which induces challenging learning problems. We propose a topological recurrent neural model which exhibits good experimental performances for diffusion modelling and prediction. ",

We illustrate that when the trust region is constructed by KL divergence constraint, normalizing flows policy can generate samples far from the 'center' of the previous policy iterate, which potentially enables better exploration and helps avoid bad local optima. We show that normalizing flows policy significantly improves upon factorized Gaussian policy baseline, with both TRPO and ACKTR, especially on tasks with complex dynamics such as Humanoid.",

    "title": "Complementary-label learning for arbitrary losses and models",
    "abstract": "In contrast to the standard classification paradigm where the true (or possibly noisy) class is given to each training pattern, complementary-label learning only uses training patterns each equipped with a complementary label. This only specifies one of the classes that the pattern does not belong to. The seminal paper on complementary-label learning proposed an unbiased estimator of the classification risk that can be computed only from complementarily labeled data. How- ever, it required a restrictive condition on the loss functions, making it impossible to use popular losses such as the softmax cross-entropy loss. Recently, another formulation with the softmax cross-entropy loss was proposed with consistency guarantee. However, this formulation does not explicitly involve a risk estimator. Thus model/hyper-parameter selection is not possible by cross-validation— we may need additional ordinarily labeled data for validation purposes, which is not available in the current setup. In this paper, we give a novel general framework of complementary-label learning, and derive an unbiased risk estimator for arbitrary losses and models. We further improve the risk estimator by non-negative correction and demonstrate its superiority through experiments.",

    "title": "Guided Exploration in Deep Reinforcement Learning",
    "abstract": "This paper proposes a new method to drastically speed up deep reinforcement learning (deep RL) training for problems that have the property of \\textit{state-action permissibility} (SAP). Two types of permissibility are defined under SAP. The first type says that after an action $a_t$ is performed in a state $s_t$ and the agent reaches the new state $s_{t+1}$, the agent can decide whether the action $a_t$ is \\textit{permissible} or \\textit{not permissible} in state $s_t$. The second type says that even without performing the action $a_t$ in state $s_t$, the agent can already decide whether $a_t$ is permissible or not in $s_t$. An action is not permissible in a state if the action can never lead to an optimal solution and thus should not be tried. We incorporate the proposed SAP property into two state-of-the-art deep RL algorithms to guide their state-action exploration. Results show that the SAP guidance can markedly speed up training.",

    "abstract": "Latent variable models have been widely applied for the analysis and visualization of large datasets. In the case of sequential data, closed-form inference is possible when the transition and observation functions are linear. However, approximate inference techniques are usually necessary when dealing with nonlinear evolution and observations. Here, we propose a novel variational inference framework for the explicit modeling of time series, Variational Inference for Nonlinear Dynamics (VIND), that is able to uncover nonlinear observation and latent dynamics from sequential data. The framework includes a structured approximate posterior, and an algorithm that relies on the fixed-point iteration method to find the best estimate for latent trajectories. We apply the method to several datasets and show that it is able to accurately infer the underlying dynamics of these systems, in some cases substantially outperforming state-of-the-art methods.",

    "title": "Uncertainty-guided Lifelong Learning in Bayesian Networks",
    "abstract": "Sequentially learning of tasks arriving in a continuous stream is a complex problem and becomes more challenging when the model has a fixed capacity. Lifelong learning aims at learning new tasks without forgetting  previously learnt ones as well as freeing up capacity for learning future tasks. We argue that identifying the most influential parameters in a representation learned for one task plays a critical role to decide on \\textit{what to remember} for continual learning.  Motivated by the statistically-grounded uncertainty defined in Bayesian neural networks, we propose to formulate a Bayesian lifelong learning framework, \\texttt{BLLL}, that addresses two lifelong learning directions: 1)  completely eliminating catastrophic forgetting using weight pruning, where a hard selection mask freezes the most certain parameters (\\texttt{BLLL-PRN}) and 2) reducing catastrophic forgetting by adaptively regularizing the learning rates using the parameter uncertainty (\\texttt{BLLL-REG}). While \\texttt{BLLL-PRN} is by definition a  zero-forgetting guaranteed method, \\texttt{BLLL-REG}, despite exhibiting some small forgetting, is a task-agnostic lifelong learner, which does not require to know when a new task arrives. This feature makes \\texttt{BLLL-REG} a more convenient candidate for applications such as robotics or on-line learning in which such information is not available. We evaluate our Bayesian learning approaches extensively on diverse object classification datasets in short and long sequences of tasks and perform superior or marginally better than the existing approaches.",

By observing that a ReLU neuron is a product of a linear function with a gate (the latter determines whether the neuron is active or not), where both share a jointly trained weight vector, we propose to decouple the two. We introduce GaLU networks — networks in which each neuron is a product of a Linear Unit, defined by a weight vector which is being trained, with a Gate, defined by a different weight vector which is not being trained. Generally speaking, given a base model and a simpler version of it, the two parameters that determine the quality of the simpler version are whether its practical performance is close enough to the base model and whether it is easier to analyze it theoretically. We show that GaLU networks perform similarly to ReLU networks on standard datasets and we initiate a study of their theoretical properties, demonstrating that they are indeed easier to analyze. We believe that further research of GaLU networks may be fruitful for the development of a theory of deep learning.",

    "title": "Bayesian Policy Optimization for Model Uncertainty",
    "abstract": "Addressing uncertainty is critical for autonomous systems to robustly adapt to the real world. We formulate the problem of model uncertainty as a continuous Bayes-Adaptive Markov Decision Process (BAMDP), where an agent maintains a posterior distribution over latent model parameters given a history of observations and maximizes its expected long-term reward with respect to this belief distribution. Our algorithm, Bayesian Policy Optimization, builds on recent policy optimization algorithms to learn a universal policy that navigates the exploration-exploitation trade-off to maximize the Bayesian value function. To address challenges from discretizing the continuous latent parameter space, we propose a new policy network architecture that encodes the belief distribution independently from the observable state. Our method significantly outperforms algorithms that address model uncertainty without explicitly reasoning about belief distributions and is competitive with state-of-the-art Partially Observable Markov Decision Process solvers.",

    "title": "Value Propagation Networks",
    "abstract": "We present Value Propagation (VProp), a set of parameter-efficient differentiable planning modules built on Value Iteration which can successfully be trained using reinforcement learning to solve unseen tasks, has the capability to generalize to larger map sizes, and can learn to navigate in dynamic environments. We show that the modules enable learning to plan when the environment also includes stochastic elements, providing a cost-efficient learning system to build low-level size-invariant planners for a variety of interactive navigation problems. We evaluate on static and dynamic configurations of MazeBase grid-worlds, with randomly generated environments of several different sizes, and on a StarCraft navigation scenario, with more complex dynamics, and pixels as input.",

    "title": "Discrete Structural Planning for Generating Diverse Translations",
    "abstract": "Planning is important for humans when producing complex languages, which is a missing part in current language generation models. In this work, we add a planning phase in neural machine translation to control the global sentence structure ahead of translation. Our approach learns discrete structural representations to encode syntactic information of target sentences. During translation, we can either let beam search to choose the structural codes automatically or specify the codes manually. The word generation is then conditioned on the selected discrete codes. Experiments show that the translation performance remains intact by learning the codes to capture pure structural variations. Through structural planning, we are able to control the global sentence structure by manipulating the codes. By evaluating with a proposed structural diversity metric, we found that the sentences sampled using different codes have much higher diversity scores. In qualitative analysis, we demonstrate that the sampled paraphrase translations have drastically different structures. ",

    "abstract": "We introduce Dynamic Planning Networks (DPN), a novel architecture for deep reinforcement learning, that combines model-based and model-free aspects for online planning. Our architecture learns to dynamically construct plans using a learned state-transition model by selecting and traversing between simulated states and actions to maximize valuable information before acting. In contrast to model-free methods, model-based planning lets the agent efficiently test action hypotheses without performing costly trial-and-error in the environment. DPN learns to efficiently form plans by expanding a single action-conditional state transition at a time instead of exhaustively evaluating each action, reducing the required number of state-transitions during planning by up to 96%. We observe various emergent planning patterns used to solve environments, including classical search methods such as breadth-first and depth-first search. Learning To Plan shows improved data efficiency, performance, and generalization to new and unseen domains in comparison to several baselines.",

    "title": "Composing Entropic Policies using Divergence Correction",
    "abstract": "Deep reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms have made great strides in recent years. An important remaining challenge is the ability to quickly transfer existing skills to novel tasks, and to combine existing skills with newly acquired ones. In domains where tasks are solved by composing skills this capacity holds the promise of dramatically reducing the data requirements of deep RL algorithms, and hence increasing their applicability. Recent work has studied ways of composing behaviors represented in the form of action-value functions. We analyze these methods to highlight their strengths and weaknesses, and point out situations where each of them is susceptible to poor performance. To perform this analysis we extend generalized policy improvement to the max-entropy framework and introduce a method for the practical implementation of successor features in continuous action spaces. Then we propose a novel approach which, in principle, recovers the optimal policy during transfer. This method works by explicitly learning the (discounted, future) divergence between policies. We study this approach in the  tabular case and propose a scalable variant that is applicable in multi-dimensional continuous action spaces.\nWe compare our approach with existing ones on a range of non-trivial continuous control problems with compositional structure, and demonstrate qualitatively better performance despite not requiring simultaneous observation of all task rewards.",

    "abstract": "We consider the problem of using variational latent-variable models for data compression. For such models to produce a compressed binary sequence, which is the universal data representation in a digital world, the latent representation needs to be subjected to entropy coding. Range coding as an entropy coding technique is optimal, but it can fail catastrophically if the computation of the prior differs even slightly between the sending and the receiving side. Unfortunately, this is a common scenario when floating point math is used and the sender and receiver operate on different hardware or software platforms, as numerical round-off is often platform dependent. We propose using integer networks as a universal solution to this problem, and demonstrate that they enable reliable cross-platform encoding and decoding of images using variational models.",

    "abstract": "This work examines batch reinforcement learning--the task of maximally exploiting a given batch of off-policy data, without further data collection. We demonstrate that due to errors introduced by extrapolation, standard off-policy deep reinforcement learning algorithms, such as DQN and DDPG, are only capable of learning with data correlated to their current policy, making them ineffective for most off-policy applications. We introduce a novel class of off-policy algorithms, batch-constrained reinforcement learning, which restricts the action space to force the agent towards behaving on-policy with respect to a subset of the given data. We extend this notion to deep reinforcement learning, and to the best of our knowledge, present the first continuous control deep reinforcement learning algorithm which can learn effectively from uncorrelated off-policy data.",

    "abstract": "Machine learning has the potential to assist many communities in using the large datasets that are becoming more and more available. Unfortunately, much of that potential is not being realized because it would require sharing data in a way that compromises privacy. In this paper, we investigate a method for ensuring (differential) privacy of the generator of the Generative Adversarial Nets (GAN) framework. The resulting model can be used for generating synthetic data on which algorithms can be trained and validated, and on which competitions can be conducted, without compromising the privacy of the original dataset. Our method modifies the Private Aggregation of Teacher Ensembles (PATE) framework and applies it to GANs. Our modified framework (which we call PATE-GAN) allows us to tightly bound the influence of any individual sample on the model, resulting in tight differential privacy guarantees and thus an improved performance over models with the same guarantees. We also look at measuring the quality of synthetic data from a new angle; we assert that for the synthetic data to be useful for machine learning researchers, the relative performance of two algorithms (trained and tested) on the synthetic dataset should be the same as their relative performance (when trained and tested) on the original dataset. Our experiments, on various datasets, demonstrate that PATE-GAN consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art method with respect to this and other notions of synthetic data quality.",

A variety of different algorithms have been introduced and improved towards human-level performance. Although technical advances have been developed for each individual algorithms, there has been strong evidence showing that further substantial improvements can be achieved by properly combining multiple approaches with difference biases and variances. In this work, we propose to use the James-Stein (JS) shrinkage estimator to combine on-policy policy gradient estimators which have low bias but high variance, with low-variance high-bias gradient estimates such as those constructed based on model-based methods or temporally smoothed averaging of historical gradients. Empirical results show that our simple shrinkage approach is very effective in practice and substantially improve the sample efficiency of the state-of-the-art on-policy methods on various continuous control tasks.\n",

    "abstract": "Multi-view learning can provide self-supervision when different views are available of the same data. Distributional hypothesis provides another form of useful self-supervision from adjacent sentences which are plentiful in large unlabelled corpora. Motivated by the asymmetry in the two hemispheres of the human brain as well as the observation that different learning architectures tend to emphasise different aspects of sentence meaning, we present two multi-view frameworks for learning sentence representations in an unsupervised fashion. One framework uses a generative objective and the other a discriminative one. In both frameworks, the final representation is an ensemble of two views, in which, one view encodes the input sentence with a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), and the other view encodes it with a simple linear model. We show that, after learning, the vectors produced by our multi-view frameworks provide improved representations over their single-view learnt counterparts, and the combination of different views gives representational improvement over each view and demonstrates solid transferability on standard downstream tasks.",

    "title": "Improving Sequence-to-Sequence Learning via Optimal Transport",
    "abstract": "Sequence-to-sequence models are commonly trained via maximum likelihood estimation (MLE). However, standard MLE training considers a word-level objective, predicting the next word given the previous ground-truth partial sentence. This procedure focuses on modeling local syntactic patterns, and may fail to capture long-range semantic structure. We present a novel solution to alleviate these issues. Our approach imposes global sequence-level guidance via new supervision based on optimal transport, enabling the overall characterization and preservation of semantic features. We further show that this method can be understood as a Wasserstein gradient flow trying to match our model to the ground truth sequence distribution. Extensive experiments are conducted to validate the utility of the proposed approach, showing consistent improvements over a wide variety of NLP tasks, including machine translation, abstractive text summarization, and image captioning.",

    "title": "A Unified Theory of Early Visual Representations from Retina to Cortex through Anatomically Constrained Deep CNNs",
    "abstract": "The vertebrate visual system is hierarchically organized to process visual information in successive stages. Neural representations vary drastically across the first stages of visual processing: at the output of the retina, ganglion cell receptive fields (RFs) exhibit a clear antagonistic center-surround structure, whereas in the primary visual cortex (V1), typical RFs are sharply tuned to a precise orientation. There is currently no unified theory explaining these differences in representations across layers. Here, using a deep convolutional neural network trained on image recognition as a model of the visual system, we show that such differences in representation can emerge as a direct consequence of different neural resource constraints on the retinal and cortical networks, and for the first time we find a single model from which both geometries spontaneously emerge at the appropriate stages of visual processing. The key constraint is a reduced number of neurons at the retinal output, consistent with the anatomy of the optic nerve as a stringent bottleneck. Second, we find that, for simple downstream cortical networks, visual representations at the retinal output emerge as nonlinear and lossy feature detectors, whereas they emerge as linear and faithful encoders of the visual scene for more complex cortical networks. This result predicts that the retinas of small vertebrates (e.g. salamander, frog) should perform sophisticated nonlinear computations, extracting features directly relevant to behavior, whereas retinas of large animals such as primates should mostly encode the visual scene linearly and respond to a much broader range of stimuli. These predictions could reconcile the two seemingly incompatible views of the retina as either performing feature extraction or efficient coding of natural scenes, by suggesting that all vertebrates lie on a spectrum between these two objectives, depending on the degree of neural resources allocated to their visual system.",

    "title": "Adversarial Examples Are a Natural Consequence of Test Error in Noise",
    "abstract": "    Over the last few years, the phenomenon of adversarial examples --- maliciously constructed inputs that fool trained machine learning models --- has captured the attention of the research community, especially when the adversary is restricted to making small modifications of a correctly handled input. At the same time, less surprisingly, image classifiers lack human-level performance on randomly corrupted images, such as images with additive Gaussian noise. In this work, we show that these are two manifestations of the same underlying phenomenon. We establish this connection in several ways. First, we find that adversarial examples exist at the same distance scales we would expect from a linear model with the same performance on corrupted images. Next, we show that Gaussian data augmentation during training improves robustness to small adversarial perturbations and that adversarial training improves robustness to several types of image corruptions. Finally, we present a model-independent upper bound on the distance from a corrupted image to its nearest error given test performance and show that in practice we already come close to achieving the bound, so that improving robustness further for the corrupted image distribution requires significantly reducing test error. All of this suggests that improving adversarial robustness should go hand in hand with improving performance in the presence of more general and realistic image corruptions. This yields a computationally tractable evaluation metric for defenses to consider: test error in noisy image distributions.",

This make it suitable to calibrate systems that make use of pre-trained\ndeep neural networks that are expensive to train for a specific task, or to directly\ntrain a calibrated deep convolutional model with Monte Carlo Dropout approximations, among others.

    "abstract": "This paper addresses the challenging problem of retrieval and matching of graph structured objects, and makes two key contributions. First, we demonstrate how  Graph Neural Networks (GNN), which have emerged as an effective model for various supervised prediction problems defined on structured data, can be trained to produce embedding of graphs in vector spaces that enables efficient similarity reasoning. Second, we propose a novel Graph Matching Network model that, given a pair of graphs as input, computes a similarity score between them by jointly reasoning on the pair through a new cross-graph attention-based matching mechanism. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our models on different domains including the challenging problem of control-flow-graph based function similarity search that plays an important role in the detection of vulnerabilities in software systems. The experimental analysis demonstrates that our models are not only able to exploit structure in the context of similarity learning but they can also outperform domain-specific baseline systems that have been carefully hand-engineered for these problems.",

    "abstract": "We present a new approach to assessing the robustness of neural networks based on estimating the proportion of inputs for which a property is violated. Specifically, we estimate the probability of the event that the property is violated under an input model. Our approach critically varies from the formal verification framework in that when the property can be violated, it provides an informative notion of how robust the network is, rather than just the conventional assertion that the network is not verifiable. Furthermore, it provides an ability to scale to larger networks than formal verification approaches. Though the framework still provides a formal guarantee of satisfiability whenever it successfully finds one or more violations, these advantages do come at the cost of only providing a statistical estimate of unsatisfiability whenever no violation is found. Key to the practical success of our approach is an adaptation of multi-level splitting, a Monte Carlo approach for estimating the probability of rare events, to our statistical robustness framework. We demonstrate that our approach is able to emulate formal verification procedures on benchmark problems, while scaling to larger networks and providing reliable additional information in the form of accurate estimates of the violation probability.",

    "abstract": "The human ability to recognize objects is impaired when the object is not shown in full. \"Minimal images\" are the smallest regions of an image that remain recognizable for humans. Ullman et al. (2016) show that a slight modification of the location and size of the visible region of the minimal image produces a sharp drop in human recognition accuracy. In this paper, we demonstrate that such drops in accuracy due to changes of the visible region are a common phenomenon between humans and existing state-of-the-art deep neural networks (DNNs), and are much more prominent in DNNs. We found many cases where DNNs classified one region correctly and the other incorrectly, though they only differed by one row or column of pixels, and were often bigger than the average human minimal image size. We show that this phenomenon is independent from previous works that have reported lack of invariance to minor modifications in object location in DNNs. Our results thus reveal a new failure mode of DNNs that also affects humans to a much lesser degree. They expose how fragile DNN recognition ability is in natural images even without adversarial patterns being introduced. Bringing the robustness of DNNs in natural images to the human level remains an open challenge for the community. ",

    "title": "On the Sensitivity of Adversarial Robustness to Input Data Distributions",
    "abstract": "Neural networks are vulnerable to small adversarial perturbations. Existing literature largely focused on understanding and mitigating the vulnerability of learned models. In this paper, we demonstrate an intriguing phenomenon about the most popular robust training method in the literature, adversarial training: Adversarial robustness, unlike clean accuracy, is sensitive to the input data distribution. Even a semantics-preserving transformations on the input data distribution can cause a significantly different robustness for the adversarial trained model that is both trained and evaluated on the new distribution. Our discovery of such sensitivity on data distribution is based on a study which disentangles the behaviors of clean accuracy and robust accuracy of the Bayes classifier. Empirical investigations further confirm our finding. We construct semantically-identical variants for MNIST and CIFAR10 respectively, and show that standardly trained models achieve comparable clean accuracies on them, but adversarially trained models achieve significantly different robustness accuracies. This counter-intuitive phenomenon indicates that input data distribution alone can affect the adversarial robustness of trained neural networks, not necessarily the tasks themselves. Lastly, we discuss the practical implications on evaluating adversarial robustness, and make initial attempts to understand this complex phenomenon.",

    "abstract": "We propose a method to incrementally learn an embedding space over the domain of network architectures, to enable the careful selection of architectures for evaluation during compressed architecture search. Given a teacher network, we search for a compressed network architecture by using Bayesian Optimization (BO) with a kernel function defined over our proposed embedding space to select architectures for evaluation. We demonstrate that our search algorithm can significantly outperform various baseline methods, such as random search and reinforcement learning (Ashok et al., 2018). The compressed architectures found by our method are also better than the state-of-the-art manually-designed compact architecture ShuffleNet (Zhang et al., 2018). We also demonstrate that the learned embedding space can be transferred to new settings for architecture search, such as a larger teacher network or a teacher network in a different architecture family, without any training.",

    "title": "Parameter efficient training of deep convolutional neural networks by dynamic sparse reparameterization",
    "abstract": "Modern deep neural networks are highly overparameterized, and often of huge sizes.  A number of post-training model compression techniques, such as distillation, pruning and quantization, can reduce the size of network parameters by a substantial fraction with little loss in performance.  However, training a small network of the post-compression size de novo typically fails to reach the same level of accuracy achieved by compression of a large network, leading to a widely-held belief that gross overparameterization is essential to effective learning.  In this work, we argue that this is not necessarily true.   We describe a dynamic sparse reparameterization technique that closed the performance gap between a model compressed through iterative pruning and a model of the post-compression size trained de novo.  We applied our method to training deep residual networks and showed that it outperformed existing reparameterization techniques, yielding the best accuracy for a given parameter budget for training.  Compared to existing dynamic reparameterization methods that reallocate non-zero parameters during training, our approach achieved better performance at lower computational cost.  Our method is not only of practical value for training under stringent memory constraints, but also potentially informative to theoretical understanding of generalization properties of overparameterized deep neural networks.  \n\n",

    "title": "Learning Diverse Generations using Determinantal Point Processes",
    "abstract": "Generative models have proven to be an outstanding tool for representing high-dimensional probability distributions and generating realistic looking images. A fundamental characteristic of generative models is their ability to produce multi-modal outputs. However, while training, they are often susceptible to mode collapse, which means that the model is limited in mapping the input noise to only a few modes of the true data distribution. In this paper, we draw inspiration from Determinantal Point Process (DPP) to devise a generative model that alleviates mode collapse while producing higher quality samples. DPP is an elegant probabilistic measure used to model negative correlations within a subset and hence quantify its diversity. We use DPP kernel to model the diversity in real data as well as in synthetic data. Then, we devise a generation penalty term that encourages the generator to synthesize data with a similar diversity to real data. In contrast to previous state-of-the-art generative models that tend to use additional trainable parameters or complex training paradigms, our method does not change the original training scheme. Embedded in an adversarial training and variational autoencoder, our  Generative DPP approach shows a consistent resistance to mode-collapse on a wide-variety of synthetic data and natural image datasets including MNIST, CIFAR10, and CelebA, while outperforming state-of-the-art methods for data-efficiency, convergence-time, and generation quality. Our code will be made publicly available.",

Motivated by the absence of a model satisfying all these requirements, we propose TD-VAE, a generative sequence model that learns representations containing explicit beliefs about states several steps into the future, and that can be rolled out directly without single-step transitions. TD-VAE is trained on pairs of temporally separated time points, using an analogue of temporal difference learning used in reinforcement learning.",

    "abstract": "Neural text generation models such as recurrent networks are typically trained by maximizing data log-likelihood based on cross entropy. Such training objective shows a discrepancy from test criteria like the BLEU metric. Recent work optimizes expected BLEU under the model distribution using policy gradient, while such algorithm can suffer from high variance and become impractical. In this paper, we propose a new Differentiable Expected BLEU (DEBLEU) objective that permits direct optimization of neural generation models with gradient descent. We leverage the decomposability and sparsity of BLEU, and reformulate it with moderate approximations, making the evaluation of the objective and its gradient efficient, comparable to common cross-entropy loss. We further devise a simple training procedure with ground-truth masking and annealing for stable optimization. Experiments on neural machine translation and image captioning show our method significantly improves over both cross-entropy and policy gradient training.",

    "abstract": "Batch Normalization (BN) is a common technique used to speed-up and stabilize training. On the other hand, the learnable parameters of BN are commonly used in conditional Generative Adversarial Networks (cGANs) for representing class-specific information using conditional Batch Normalization (cBN). In this paper we propose to generalize both BN and cBN using a Whitening and Coloring based batch normalization. We show that our conditional Coloring can represent categorical conditioning information which largely helps the cGAN qualitative results. Moreover, we show that full-feature whitening is important in a general GAN scenario in which the training process is known to be highly unstable. We test our approach on different datasets and using different GAN networks and training protocols, showing a consistent improvement in all the tested frameworks. Our CIFAR-10 conditioned results are higher than all previous works on this dataset.",

    "abstract": "While momentum-based methods, in conjunction with the stochastic gradient descent, are widely used when training machine learning models, there is little theoretical understanding on the generalization error of such methods. In practice, the momentum parameter is often chosen in a heuristic fashion with little theoretical guidance. In this work, we use the framework of algorithmic stability to provide an upper-bound on the generalization error for the class of strongly convex loss functions, under mild technical assumptions. Our bound decays to zero inversely with the size of the training set, and increases as the momentum parameter is increased. We also develop an upper-bound on the expected true risk,  in terms of the number of training steps, the size of the training set, and the momentum parameter.",

    "abstract": "In this work, we address the problem of musical timbre transfer, where the goal is to manipulate the timbre of a sound sample from one instrument to match another instrument while preserving other musical content, such as pitch, rhythm, and loudness. In principle, one could apply image-based style transfer techniques to a time-frequency representation of an audio signal, but this depends on having a representation that allows independent manipulation of timbre as well as high-quality waveform generation. We introduce TimbreTron, a method for musical timbre transfer which applies “image” domain style transfer to a time-frequency representation of the audio signal, and then produces a high-quality waveform using a conditional WaveNet synthesizer. We show that the Constant Q Transform (CQT) representation is particularly well-suited to convolutional architectures due to its approximate pitch equivariance. Based on human perceptual evaluations, we confirmed that TimbreTron recognizably transferred the timbre while otherwise preserving the musical content, for both monophonic and polyphonic samples. We made an accompanying demo video here: https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~huang/TimbreTron/index.html which we strongly encourage you to watch before reading the paper.",

    "abstract": "Many real world tasks exhibit rich structure that is repeated across different parts of the state space or in time. In this work we study the possibility of leveraging such repeated structure to speed up and regularize learning. We start from the KL regularized expected reward objective which introduces an additional component, a default policy. Instead of relying on a fixed default policy, we learn it from data. But crucially, we restrict the amount of information the default policy receives, forcing it to learn reusable behaviors that help the policy learn faster. We formalize this strategy and discuss connections to information bottleneck approaches and to the variational EM algorithm. We present empirical results in both discrete and continuous action domains and demonstrate that, for certain tasks, learning a default policy alongside the policy can significantly speed up and improve learning.\nPlease watch the video demonstrating learned experts and default policies on several continuous control tasks ( https://youtu.be/U2qA3llzus8 ).",

In this paper we examine a specific result of this disparity, namely a strong bias of the time-bounded Every-visit Monte Carlo value estimator. This manifests as a vastly different learning dynamic for algorithms that use value predictors, including encouraging or discouraging exploration.\n\nWe investigate these claims theoretically for a one dimensional random walk, and empirically on a number of simple environments. We use GAE as an algorithm involving a value predictor and evolution strategies as a reference point.",

It builds these graphs recurrently for each step of the described procedure, and uses them to track the evolving states of participant entities. We harness and extend a recently proposed machine reading comprehension(MRC) model to query for entity states, since these states are generally communicated in spans of text and MRC models perform well in extracting entity-centric spans.   The  explicit,  structured,  and  evolving  knowledge  graph  representations that our model constructs can be used in downstream question answering tasks to improve machine comprehension of text, as we demonstrate empirically.  On two comprehension tasks from the recently proposed  ProPara dataset,  our model achieves state-of-the-art results. We further show that our model is competitive on the Recipes dataset, suggesting it may be generally applicable.",

Exploiting variable augmentation, REINFORCE, and reparameterization, the ARM estimator achieves adaptive variance reduction for Monte Carlo integration by merging two expectations via common random numbers. The variance-reduction mechanism of the ARM estimator can also be attributed to either antithetic sampling in an augmented space, or the use of an optimal anti-symmetric \"self-control\" baseline function together with the REINFORCE estimator in that augmented space. Experimental results show the ARM estimator provides state-of-the-art performance in auto-encoding variational inference and maximum likelihood estimation, for discrete latent variable models with one or multiple stochastic binary layers.

    "abstract": "Gated recurrent networks such as those composed of Long Short-Term Memory\n(LSTM) nodes have recently been used to improve state of the art in many sequential\nprocessing tasks such as speech recognition and machine translation. However,\nthe basic structure of the LSTM node is essentially the same as when it was\nfirst conceived 25 years ago. Recently, evolutionary and reinforcement learning\nmechanisms have been employed to create new variations of this structure. This\npaper proposes a new method, evolution of a tree-based encoding of the gated\nmemory nodes, and shows that it makes it possible to explore new variations more\neffectively than other methods. The method discovers nodes with multiple recurrent\npaths and multiple memory cells, which lead to significant improvement in the\nstandard language modeling benchmark task. Remarkably, this node did not perform\nwell in another task, music modeling, but it was possible to evolve a different\nnode that did, demonstrating that the approach discovers customized structure for\neach task. The paper also shows how the search process can be speeded up by\ntraining an LSTM network to estimate performance of candidate structures, and\nby encouraging exploration of novel solutions. Thus, evolutionary design of complex\nneural network structures promises to improve performance of deep learning\narchitectures beyond human ability to do so.",

    "title": "Exemplar Guided Unsupervised Image-to-Image Translation with Semantic Consistency",
    "abstract": "Image-to-image translation has recently received significant attention due to advances in deep learning. Most works focus on learning either a one-to-one mapping in an unsupervised way or a many-to-many mapping in a supervised way. However, a more practical setting is many-to-many mapping in an unsupervised way, which is harder due to the lack of supervision and the complex inner- and cross-domain variations. To alleviate these issues, we propose the Exemplar Guided & Semantically Consistent Image-to-image Translation (EGSC-IT) network which conditions the translation process on an exemplar image in the target domain. We assume that an image comprises of a content component which is shared across domains, and a style component specific to each domain. Under the guidance of an exemplar from the target domain we apply Adaptive Instance Normalization to the shared content component, which allows us to transfer the style information of the target domain to the source domain. To avoid semantic inconsistencies during translation that naturally appear due to the large inner- and cross-domain variations, we introduce the concept of feature masks that provide coarse semantic guidance without requiring the use of any semantic labels. Experimental results on various datasets show that EGSC-IT does not only translate the source image to diverse instances in the target domain, but also preserves the semantic consistency during the process.

    "title": "Perception-Aware Point-Based Value Iteration for Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes",
    "abstract": "Partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs) are a widely-used framework to model decision-making with uncertainty about the environment and under stochastic outcome. In conventional POMDP models, the observations that the agent receives originate from fixed known distribution. However, in a variety of real-world scenarios the agent has an active role in its perception by selecting which observations to receive. Due to combinatorial nature of such selection process, it is computationally intractable to integrate the perception decision with the planning decision. To prevent such expansion of the action space, we propose a greedy strategy for observation selection that aims to minimize the uncertainty in state. \nWe develop a novel point-based value iteration algorithm that incorporates the greedy strategy to achieve near-optimal uncertainty reduction for sampled belief points. This in turn enables the solver to efficiently approximate the reachable subspace of belief simplex by essentially separating computations related to perception from planning.\nLastly, we implement the proposed solver and demonstrate its performance and computational advantage in a range of robotic scenarios where the robot simultaneously performs active perception and planning.",

    "abstract": "Binarized Neural Networks (BNNs) have recently attracted significant interest due to their computational efficiency. Concurrently, it has been shown that neural networks may be overly sensitive to ``attacks\" -- tiny adversarial changes in the input -- which may be detrimental to their use in safety-critical domains. Designing attack algorithms that effectively fool trained models is a key step towards learning robust neural networks.\nThe discrete, non-differentiable nature of BNNs, which distinguishes them from their full-precision counterparts, poses a challenge to gradient-based attacks. In this work, we study the problem of attacking a BNN through the lens of combinatorial and integer optimization. We propose a Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) formulation of the problem. While exact and flexible, the MILP quickly becomes intractable as the network and perturbation space grow. To address this issue, we propose IProp, a decomposition-based algorithm that solves a sequence of much smaller MILP problems. Experimentally, we evaluate both proposed methods against the standard gradient-based attack (PGD) on MNIST and Fashion-MNIST, and show that IProp performs favorably compared to PGD, while scaling beyond the limits of the MILP.",

This work challenges this widely-held belief, showing that larger models can potentially train faster despite the increasing computational requirements of each training step. In particular, we study the effect of network structure (depth and width) on halting time and show that larger models---wider models in particular---take fewer training steps to converge.\n\nWe design simple experiments to quantitatively characterize the effect of overparametrization on weight space traversal. Results show that halting time improves when growing model's width for three different applications, and the improvement comes from each factor: The distance from initialized weights to converged weights shrinks with a power-law-like relationship, the average step size grows with a power-law-like relationship, and gradient vectors become more aligned with each other during traversal.\n",

Estimating gradients of such objectives with respect to the distribution parameters is a challenging problem. We analyze existing solutions including finite-difference (FD) estimators and continuous relaxation (CR) estimators in terms of bias and variance. We show that the commonly used Gumbel-Softmax estimator is biased and propose a simple method to reduce it. We also derive a simpler piece-wise linear continuous relaxation that also possesses reduced bias. We demonstrate empirically that reduced bias leads to a better performance in variational inference and on binary optimization tasks.",

    "title": "A Direct Approach to Robust Deep Learning Using Adversarial Networks",
    "abstract": "Deep neural networks have been shown to perform well in many classical machine learning problems, especially in image classification tasks. However, researchers have found that neural networks can be easily fooled, and they are surprisingly sensitive to small perturbations imperceptible to humans.  Carefully crafted input images (adversarial examples) can force a well-trained neural network to provide arbitrary outputs.  Including adversarial examples during training is a popular defense mechanism against adversarial attacks. In this paper we propose a new defensive mechanism under the generative adversarial network~(GAN) framework. We model the adversarial noise using a generative network, trained jointly with a classification discriminative network as a minimax game. We show empirically that our adversarial network approach works well against black box attacks, with performance on par with state-of-art methods such as ensemble adversarial training and adversarial training with projected gradient descent.\n",

However, typical GANs require fully-observed data during training. In this paper, we present a GAN-based framework for learning from complex, high-dimensional incomplete data. The proposed framework learns a complete data generator along with a mask generator that models the missing data distribution. We further demonstrate how to impute missing data by equipping our framework with an adversarially trained imputer. We evaluate the proposed framework using a series of experiments with several types of missing data processes under the missing completely at random assumption.",

    "abstract": "We propose a robust Bayesian deep learning algorithm to infer complex posteriors with latent variables. Inspired by dropout, a popular tool for regularization and model ensemble, we assign sparse priors to the weights in deep neural networks (DNN) in order to achieve automatic “dropout” and avoid over-fitting. By alternatively sampling from posterior distribution through stochastic gradient Markov Chain Monte Carlo (SG-MCMC) and optimizing latent variables via stochastic approximation (SA), the trajectory of the target weights is proved to converge to the true posterior distribution conditioned on optimal latent variables. This ensures a stronger regularization on the over-fitted parameter space and more accurate uncertainty quantification on the decisive variables. Simulations from large-p-small-n regressions showcase the robustness of this method when applied to models with latent variables. Additionally, its application on the convolutional neural networks (CNN) leads to state-of-the-art performance on MNIST and Fashion MNIST datasets and improved resistance to adversarial attacks. ",

    "title": "Reducing Overconfident Errors outside the Known Distribution",
    "abstract": "Intuitively, unfamiliarity should lead to lack of confidence. In reality, current algorithms often make highly confident yet wrong predictions when faced with unexpected test samples from an unknown distribution different from training. Unlike domain adaptation methods, we cannot gather an \"unexpected dataset\" prior to test, and unlike novelty detection methods, a best-effort original task prediction is still expected. We compare a number of methods from related fields such as calibration and epistemic uncertainty modeling, as well as two proposed methods that reduce overconfident errors of samples from an unknown novel distribution without drastically increasing evaluation time: (1) G-distillation, training an ensemble of classifiers and then distill into a single model using both labeled and unlabeled examples, or (2) NCR, reducing prediction confidence based on its novelty detection score. Experimentally, we investigate the overconfidence problem and evaluate our solution by creating \"familiar\" and \"novel\" test splits, where \"familiar\" are identically distributed with training and \"novel\" are not. We discover that calibrating using temperature scaling on familiar data is the best single-model method for improving novel confidence, followed by our proposed methods. In addition, some methods' NLL performance are roughly equivalent to a regularly trained model with certain degree of smoothing. Calibrating can also reduce confident errors, for example, in gender recognition by 95% on demographic groups different from the training data.",

    "title": "Count-Based Exploration with the Successor Representation",
    "abstract": "The problem of exploration in reinforcement learning is well-understood in the tabular case and many sample-efficient algorithms are known. Nevertheless, it is often unclear how the algorithms in the tabular setting can be extended to tasks with large state-spaces where generalization is required. Recent promising developments generally depend on problem-specific density models or handcrafted features. In this paper we introduce a simple approach for exploration that allows us to develop theoretically justified algorithms in the tabular case but that also give us intuitions for new algorithms applicable to settings where function approximation is required. Our approach and its underlying theory is based on the substochastic successor representation, a concept we develop here. While the traditional successor representation is a representation that defines state generalization by the similarity of successor states, the substochastic successor representation is also able to implicitly count the number of times each state (or feature) has been observed. This extension connects two until now disjoint areas of research. We show in traditional tabular domains (RiverSwim and SixArms) that our algorithm empirically performs as well as other sample-efficient algorithms. We then describe a deep reinforcement learning algorithm inspired by these ideas and show that it matches the performance of recent pseudo-count-based methods in hard exploration Atari 2600 games.",

    "title": "Feature quantization for parsimonious and interpretable predictive models",
    "abstract": "For regulatory and interpretability reasons, the logistic regression is still widely used by financial institutions to learn the refunding probability of a loan from applicant's historical data. To improve prediction accuracy and interpretability, a preprocessing step quantizing both continuous and categorical data is usually performed: continuous features are discretized by assigning factor levels to intervals and, if numerous, levels of categorical features are grouped. However, a better predictive accuracy can be reached by embedding this quantization estimation step directly into the predictive estimation step itself. By doing so, the predictive loss has to be optimized on a huge and untractable discontinuous quantization set. To overcome this difficulty, we introduce a specific two-step optimization strategy: first, the optimization problem is relaxed by approximating discontinuous quantization functions by smooth functions; second, the resulting relaxed optimization problem is solved via a particular neural network and stochastic gradient descent. The strategy gives then access to good candidates for the original optimization problem after a straightforward maximum a posteriori procedure to obtain cutpoints. The good performances of this approach, which we call glmdisc, are illustrated on simulated and real data from the UCI library and Crédit Agricole Consumer Finance (a major European historic player in the consumer credit market). The results show that practitioners finally have an automatic all-in-one tool that answers their recurring needs of quantization for predictive tasks.",

    "abstract": "Auxiliary learning has been shown to improve the generalisation performance of a principal task. But typically, this requires manually-defined auxiliary tasks based on domain knowledge. In this paper, we consider that it may be possible to automatically learn these auxiliary tasks to best suit the principal task, towards optimum auxiliary tasks without any human knowledge. We propose a novel method, Meta Auxiliary Learning (MAXL), which we design for the task of image classification, where the auxiliary task is hierarchical sub-class image classification. The role of the meta learner is to determine sub-class target labels to train a multi-task evaluator, such that these labels improve the generalisation performance on the principal task. Experiments on three different CIFAR datasets show that MAXL outperforms baseline auxiliary learning methods, and is competitive even with a method which uses human-defined sub-class hierarchies. MAXL is self-supervised and general, and therefore offers a promising new direction towards automated generalisation.",

    "abstract": "In traditional neural networks for image processing, the inputs of the neural networks should be the same size such as 224×224×3. But how can we train the neural net model with different input size? A common way to do is image deformation which accompany a problem of information loss (e.g. image crop or wrap). In this paper we propose a new network structure called Attention Incorporate Network(AIN). It solve the problem of different size of input images and extract the key features of the inputs by attention mechanism, pay different attention depends on the importance of the features not rely on the data size. Experimentally, AIN achieve a higher accuracy, better convergence comparing to the same size of other network structure.",

We demonstrate how this platform can be used to study behavior and learning in large populations of neural agents. Unlike currently popular game environments, our platform supports persistent environments, with variable number of agents, and open-ended task descriptions. The emergence of complex life on Earth is often attributed to the arms race that ensued from a huge number of organisms all competing for finite resources. Our platform aims to simulate this setting in microcosm: we conduct a series of experiments to test how large-scale multiagent competition can incentivize the development of skillful behavior. We find that population size magnifies the complexity of the behaviors that emerge and results in agents that out-compete agents trained in smaller populations.",

    "abstract": "Multilingual machine translation, which translates multiple languages with a single model, has attracted much attention due to its efficiency of offline training and online serving. However, traditional multilingual translation usually yields inferior accuracy compared with the counterpart using individual models for each language pair, due to language diversity and model capacity limitations. In this paper, we propose a distillation-based approach to boost the accuracy of multilingual machine translation. Specifically, individual models are first trained and regarded as teachers, and then the multilingual model is trained to fit the training data and match the outputs of individual models simultaneously through knowledge distillation. Experiments on IWSLT, WMT and Ted talk translation datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. Particularly, we show that one model is enough to handle multiple languages (up to 44 languages in our experiment), with comparable or even better accuracy than individual models.",

Unlike the widely used classification method, this architecture does not require the labels of data and the number of classes. Our key idea is to introduce a approximate linear map and a spectral clustering theory on the dimension reduced spaces into generative adversarial networks. Inspired by the human visual recognition system, the proposed framework can classify and also generate images as the human brains do. We build an approximate linear connector network $C$ analogous to the cerebral cortex, between the discriminator $D$ and the generator $G$. The connector network allows us to estimate the unknown number of classes. Estimating the number of classes is one of the challenging researches in the unsupervised learning, especially in spectral clustering. The proposed method can also classify the images by using the estimated number of classes. Therefore, we define our method as an unsupervised classification method.",

    "abstract": "Stochastic video prediction models take in a sequence of image frames, and generate a sequence of consecutive future image frames. These models typically generate future frames in an autoregressive fashion, which is slow and requires the input and output frames to be consecutive. We introduce a model that overcomes these drawbacks by generating a latent representation from an arbitrary set of frames that can then be used to simultaneously and efficiently sample temporally consistent frames at arbitrary time-points. For example, our model can \"jump\" and directly sample frames at the end of the video, without sampling intermediate frames. Synthetic video evaluations confirm substantial gains in speed and functionality without loss in fidelity. We also apply our framework to a 3D scene reconstruction dataset. Here, our model is conditioned on camera location and can sample consistent sets of images for what an occluded region of a 3D scene might look like, even if there are multiple possibilities for what that region might contain. Reconstructions and videos are available at https://bit.ly/2O4Pc4R.\n",

    "title": "Learning Finite State Representations of Recurrent Policy Networks",
    "abstract": "Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are an effective representation of control policies for a wide range of reinforcement and imitation learning problems. RNN policies, however, are particularly difficult to explain, understand, and analyze due to their use of continuous-valued memory vectors and observation features. In this paper, we introduce a new technique, Quantized Bottleneck Insertion, to learn finite representations of these vectors and features. The result is a quantized representation of the RNN that can be analyzed to improve our understanding of memory use and general behavior. We present results of this approach on synthetic environments and six Atari games. The resulting finite representations are surprisingly small in some cases, using as few as 3 discrete memory states and 10 observations for a perfect Pong policy. We also show that these finite policy representations lead to improved interpretability. ",

    "title": "Learning Representations in Model-Free Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning",
    "abstract": "Common approaches to Reinforcement Learning (RL) are seriously challenged by large-scale applications involving huge state spaces and sparse delayed reward feedback. Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning (HRL) methods attempt to address this scalability issue by learning action selection policies at multiple levels of temporal abstraction. Abstraction can be had by identifying a relatively small set of states that are likely to be useful as subgoals, in concert with the learning of corresponding skill policies to achieve those subgoals. Many approaches to subgoal discovery in HRL depend on the analysis of a model of the environment, but the need to learn such a model introduces its own problems of scale. Once subgoals are identified, skills may be learned through intrinsic motivation, introducing an internal reward signal marking subgoal attainment. In this paper, we present a novel model-free method for subgoal discovery using incremental unsupervised learning over a small memory of the most recent experiences of the agent. When combined with an intrinsic motivation learning mechanism, this method learns subgoals and skills together, based on experiences in the environment. Thus, we offer an original approach to HRL that does not require the acquisition of a model of the environment, suitable for large-scale applications. We demonstrate the efficiency of our method on two RL problems with sparse delayed feedback: a variant of the rooms environment and the ATARI 2600 game called Montezuma's Revenge.\n",

    "abstract": "Importance sampling is a common approach to off-policy learning in reinforcement learning.  While it is consistent and unbiased, it can result in high variance updates to the parameters for the value function. Weighted importance sampling (WIS) has been explored to reduce variance for off-policy policy evaluation, but only for linear value function approximation. In this work, we explore a resampling strategy to reduce variance, rather than a reweighting strategy. We propose Importance Resampling (IR) for off-policy learning, that resamples experience from the replay buffer and applies a standard on-policy update. The approach avoids using importance sampling ratios directly in the update, instead correcting the distribution over transitions before the update. We characterize the bias and consistency of the our estimator, particularly compared to WIS. We then demonstrate in several toy domains that IR has improved sample efficiency and parameter sensitivity, as compared to several baseline WIS estimators and to IS. We conclude with a demonstration showing IR improves over IS for learning a value function from images in a racing car simulator.",

    "abstract": "Predicting the outcome of pharmacological assays based on high-resolution microscopy\nimages of treated cells is a crucial task in drug discovery which tremendously\nincreases discovery rates. However, end-to-end learning on these images\nwith convolutional neural networks (CNNs) has not been ventured for this task\nbecause it has been considered infeasible and overly complex. On the largest\navailable public dataset, we compare several state-of-the-art CNNs trained in an\nend-to-end fashion with models based on a cell-centric approach involving segmentation.\nWe found that CNNs operating on full images containing hundreds\nof cells perform significantly better at assay prediction than networks operating\non a single-cell level. Surprisingly, we could predict 29% of the 209 pharmacological\nassays at high predictive performance (AUC > 0.9). We compared a\nnovel CNN architecture called “GapNet” against four competing CNN architectures\nand found that it performs on par with the best methods and at the same time\nhas the lowest training time. Our results demonstrate that end-to-end learning on\nhigh-resolution imaging data is not only possible but even outperforms cell-centric\nand segmentation-dependent approaches. Hence, the costly cell segmentation and\nfeature extraction steps are not necessary, in fact they even hamper predictive performance.\nOur work further suggests that many pharmacological assays could\nbe replaced by high-resolution microscopy imaging together with convolutional\nneural networks.",

    "title": "Modeling Dynamics of Biological Systems with Deep Generative Neural Networks",
    "abstract": "Biological data often contains measurements of dynamic entities such as cells or organisms in various states of progression. However, biological systems are notoriously difficult to describe analytically due to their many interacting components, and in many cases, the technical challenge of taking longitudinal measurements. This leads to difficulties in studying the features of the dynamics, for examples the drivers of the transition. To address this problem, we present a deep neural network framework we call Dynamics Modeling Network or DyMoN. DyMoN is a neural network framework trained as a deep generative Markov model whose next state is a probability distribution based on the current state. DyMoN is well-suited to the idiosyncrasies of biological data, including noise, sparsity, and the lack of longitudinal measurements in many types of systems. Thus, DyMoN can be trained using probability distributions derived from the data in any way, such as trajectories derived via dimensionality reduction methods, and does not require longitudinal measurements. We show the advantage of learning deep models over shallow models such as Kalman filters and hidden Markov models that do not learn representations of the data, both in terms of learning embeddings of the data and also in terms training efficiency, accuracy and ability to multitask. We perform three case studies of applying DyMoN to different types of biological systems and extracting features of the dynamics in each case by examining the learned model. ",
